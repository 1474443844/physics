# Welcome to the Open XML SDK for

# Office

Article • 11/15/2023

This content set provides documentation and guidance for the strongly-typed classes in the Open XML SDK for Office.

The SDK is built on the System.IO.Packaging API and provides strongly-typed classes to manipulate documents that adhere to the Office Open XML File Formats specification. The Office Open XML File Formats specification is an open, international, ECMA-376, 5th Edition and ISO/IEC 29500 standard. The Open XML file formats are useful for developers because they are an open standard and are based on well-known technologies: ZIP and XML.

The Open XML SDK simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The Open XML SDK encapsulates many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations with just a few lines of code.

Portions of ISO/IEC 29500: 2016 are referenced in the SDK.

Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO Add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.

# Getting started with the Open XML SDK

Article • 11/15/2023

The Open XML SDK simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The classes in the Open XML SDK encapsulate many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations with just a few lines of code.

## Available packages

The SDK is available as a collection of NuGet packages that support .NET 3.5+, .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 6+, and other supported platforms for those targets. For information about installing packages, please see the NuGet documentation. The following are the available packages:

DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework : This package contains the foundational framework that enables the SDK. This is a new package starting with v3.0 and contains many types that previously were included in DocumentFormat.OpenXml . DocumentFormat.OpenXml : This package contains all of the strongly typed classes for parts and elements. DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features : This package contains additional functionality that enables some opt-in features. DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq : This package contains a collection of all the fully qualified names for parts and elements to enable more efficient Linq usage.

# About the Open XML SDK for Office

Article • 01/21/2025

Open XML is an open standard for word-processing documents, presentations, and spreadsheets that can be freely implemented by multiple applications on different platforms. Open XML is designed to faithfully represent existing word-processing documents, presentations, and spreadsheets that are encoded in binary formats defined by Microsoft Office applications. The reason for Open XML is simple: billions of documents now exist but, unfortunately, the information in those documents is tightly coupled with the programs that created them. The purpose of the Open XML standard is to de-couple documents created by Microsoft Office applications so that they can be manipulated by other applications independent of proprietary formats and without the loss of data.

Office Add-ins have a small footprint compared to VSTO Add-ins and solutions, and you can build them by using almost any web programming technology, such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and XML.

## Structure of an Open XML Package

An Open XML file is stored in a ZIP archive for packaging and compression. You can view the structure of any Open XML file using a ZIP viewer. An Open XML document is built of multiple document parts. The relationships between the parts are themselves stored in document parts. The ZIP format supports random access to each part. For example, an application can move a slide from one presentation to another presentation without parsing the slide content. Likewise, an application can strip all of the comments out of a word processing document without parsing any of its contents.

The document parts in an Open XML package are created as XML markup. Because XML is structured plain text, you can view the contents of a document part using text readers or you can parse the contents using processes such as XPath.

Structurally, an Open XML document is an Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) package. As stated previously, a package is composed of a collection of document parts. Each part has a part name that consists of a sequence of segments or a pathname such as

"/word/theme/theme1.xml." The package contains a [Content_Types].xml part that allows you to determine the content type of all document parts in the package. A set of explicit relationships for a source package or part is contained in a relationships part that ends with the .rels extension.

Word processing documents are described by using WordprocessingML markup. For more information, see Working with WordprocessingML documents. A WordprocessingML document is composed of a collection of stories where each story is one of the following:

Main document (the only required story) Glossary document Header and footer Comments Text box Footnote and endnote

Presentations are described by using PresentationML markup. For more information, see Working with PresentationML documents. Presentation packages can contain the following document parts:

Slide master Notes master Handout master Slide layout Notes

Spreadsheet workbooks are described by using SpreadsheetML markup. For more information, see Working with SpreadsheetML documents. Workbook packages can contain:

Workbook part (required part) One or more worksheets Charts Tables Custom XML

## Open XML SDK for Microsoft Office

The SDK supports the following common tasks/scenarios:

Strongly Typed Classes and Objects Instead of relying on generic XML functionality to manipulate XML, which requires that you be aware of

element/attribute/value spelling as well as namespaces, you can use the Open XML SDK to accomplish the same solution simply by manipulating objects that represent elements/attributes/values. All schema types are represented as strongly typed Common Language Runtime (CLR) classes and all attribute values as enumerations. Content Construction, Search, and Manipulation The LINQ technology is built directly into the SDK. As a result, you are able to perform functional constructs and lambda expression queries directly on objects representing Open XML elements. In addition, the SDK allows you to easily traverse and manipulate content by providing support for collections of objects, like tables and paragraphs. Validation The Open XML SDK for Microsoft Office provides validation functionality, enabling you to validate Open XML documents against different variations of the Open XML Format.

## Open XML SDK for Office

The Open XML SDK provides the namespaces and members to support the Microsoft Office. The Open XML SDK can also read ISO/IEC 29500 Strict Format files. The Strict format is a subset of the Transitional format that does not include legacy features - this makes it theoretically easier for a new implementer to support since it has a smaller technical footprint.

The SDK supports the following common tasks/scenarios:

Support of Office Preview file format In addition to the Open XML SDK for Microsoft Office classes, Open XML SDK provides new classes that enable you to write and build applications to manipulate Open XML file extensions of the new Office features. Reads ISO Strict Document File Open XML SDK can read ISO/IEC 29500 Strict Format files. When the Open XML SDK API opens a Strict Format file, each Open XML part in the file is loaded to an OpenXmlPart class of the Open XML SDK by mapping https://purl.oclc.org/ooxml/ namespaces to the corresponding https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/ namespaces. Fixes to the Open XML SDK for Microsoft Office Open XML SDK includes fixes to known issues in the Open XML SDK for Microsoft Office. These include lost whitespaces in PowerPoint presentations and an issue with the Custom UI in Word documents where a specified argument was reported as being out of the range of valid values.

# What's new in the Open XML SDK

Article • 11/15/2023

## [3.0.0] - 2023-11-15

### Added

Packages can now be saved on .NET Core and .NET 5+ if constructed with a path or stream (#1307). Packages can now support malformed URIs (such as relationships with a URI such as mailto:person@ ) Introduce equality comparers for OpenXmlElement (#1476) IFeatureCollection can now be enumerated and has a helpful debug view to see what features are registered (#1452) Add mime types to part creation (#1488) DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.PowerPoint.Y2023.M02.Main namespace DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.PowerPoint.Y2022.M03.Main namespace DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.SpreadSheetML.Y2021.ExtLinks2021 namespace

### Changed

When validation finds incorrect part, it will now include the relationship type rather than a class name IDisposableFeature is now a part of the framework package and is available by default on a package or part.

### Breaking Changes

.NET Standard 1.3 is no longer a supported platform. .NET Standard 2.0 is the lowest .NET Standard supported. Core infrastructure is now contained in a new package DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework. Typed classes are still in DocumentFormat.OpenXml. This means that you may reference DocumentFormat.OpenXml and still compile the same types, but if you want a smaller package, you may rely on just the framework package. Changed type of OpenXmlPackage.Package to DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.IPackage instead of

System.IO.Packaging.Package with a similar API surface EnumValue<T> now is used to box a struct rather than a System.Enum . This allows us to enable behavior on it without resorting to reflection Methods on parts to add child parts (i.e. AddImagePart ) are now implemented as extension methods off of a new marker interface ISupportedRelationship<T> Part type info enums (i.e. ImagePartType ) is no longer an enum, but a static class to expose well-known part types as structs. Now any method to define a new content-type/extension pair can be called with the new PartTypeInfo struct that will contain the necessary information. OpenXmlPackage.CanSave is now an instance property (#1307) Removed OpenXmlSettings.RelationshipErrorHandlerFactory and associated types and replaced with a built-in mechanism to enable this IdPartPair is now a readonly struct rather than a class Renamed PartExtensionProvider to IPartExtensionFeature and reduced its surface area to only two methods (instead of a full Dictionary<,> ). The property to access this off of OpenXmlPackage has been removed, but may be accessed via Features.Get<IPartExtensionFeature>() if needed. OpenXmlPart / OpenXmlContainer / OpenXmlPackage and derived types now have internal constructors (these had internal abstract methods so most likely weren't subclassed externally) OpenXmlElementList is now a struct that implements IEnumerable<OpenXmlElement> and IReadOnlyList<OpenXmlElement> where available (#1429) Individual implementations of OpenXmlPartReader are available now for each package type (i.e. WordprocessingDocumentPartReader , SpreadsheetDocumentPartReader , PresentationDocumentPartReader ), and the previous TypedOpenXmlPartReader has been removed. (#1403) Reduced unnecessary target frameworks for packages besides DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework (#1471) Changed some spelling issues for property names (#1463, #1444) Model3D now represents the modified xml element tag name am3d.model3d (Previously am3d.model3D ) Removed

# Open XML SDK for Office design

# considerations

Article • 10/17/2023

Before using the Open XML SDK for Office, be aware of the following design considerations.

## Design Considerations

The Open XML SDK:

Does not replace the Microsoft Office Object Model and provides no abstraction on top of the file formats. You must still understand the structure of the file formats to use the Open XML SDK.

Does not provide functionality to convert Open XML formats to and from other formats, such as HTML or XPS.

Does not guarantee document validity of Open XML Formats when you use the Open XML SDK or if you decide to manipulate the underlying XML directly.

Does not provide application behavior such as layout functionality in Word or recalculation, data refresh, or adjustment functionalities in Excel.

# Migration to v3.0.0

Article • 11/15/2023

There are a number of breaking changes between v2.20.0 and v3.0.0 that may require source level changes. As a reminder, there are two kinds of breaking changes:

1. Binary: When a binary can no longer be used as drop in replacement
2. Source: When the source no longer compiles

The changes made in v3.0.0 were either a removal of obsoletions present in the SDK for a while or changes required for architectural reasons (most notably for better AOT support and trimming). Majority of these changes should be on the binary breaking change side, while still supporting compilation and expected behavior with your previous code. However, there are a few source breaking chnages to be made aware of.

## Breaking Changes

### .NET Standard 1.3 support has been dropped

No targets still in support require .NET Standard 1.3 and can use .NET Standard 2.0 instead. The project still supports .NET Framework 3.5+ and any .NET Standard 2.0 supported platform.

Action needed: If using .NET Standard 1.3, please upgrade to a supported version of .NET

### Target frameworks have changed

In order to simplify package creation, the TFMs built have been changed for some of the packages. However, there should be no apparent change to users as the overall supported platforms (besides .NET Standard 1.3 stated above) remains the same.

Action needed: None

### OpenXmlPart/OpenXmlContainer/OpenXmlPackage no

### longer have public constructors

These never initialized correct behavior and should never have been exposed.

Action needed: Use .Create(...) methods rather than constructor.

### Supporting framework for OpenXML types is now in the

### DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework package

Starting with v3.0.0, the supporting framework for the Open XML SDK is now within a standalone package, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework .

Action needed: If you would like to operate on just OpenXmlPackage types, you no longer need to bring in all the static classes and can just reference the framework library.

### System.IO.Packaging is not directly used anymore

There have been issues with getting behavior we need from the System.IO.Packaging namespace. Starting with v3.0, a new set of interfaces in the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging namespace will be used to access package properties.

７ Note

These types are currently marked as obsolete, but only in the sense that we reserve the right to change their shape per feedback. Please be careful using these types as they may change in the future. At some point, we will remove the obsoletions and they will be considered stable APIs. See here for details.

Action needed: If using OpenXmlPackage.Package , the package returned is no longer of type System.IO.Packaging.Package , but of DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.IPackage .

### Methods on parts to add child parts are now extension

### methods

There was a number of duplicated methods that would add parts in well defined ways. In order to consolidate this, if a part supports ISupportedRelationship<T> , extension methods can be written to support specific behavior that part can provide. Existing methods for this should transparently be retargeted to the new extension methods upon compilation.

Action needed: None

### OpenXmlAttribute is now a readonly struct

This type used to have mutable getters and setters. As a struct, this was easy to misuse, and should have been made readonly from the start.

Action needed: If expecting to mutate an OpenXmlAttribute in place, please create a new one instead.

### EnumValue<TEnum> now contains structs

Starting with v3.0.0, EnumValue<T> wraps a custom type that contains the information about the enum value. Previously, these types were stored in enum values in the C# type system, but required reflection to access, causing very large AOT compiled applications.

Action needed: Similar API surface is available, however the exposed enum values for this are no longer constants and will not be available in a few scenarios they had been (i.e. attribute values).

A common change that is required is switch statements no longer work:

C#

switch (theCell.DataType.Value) { case CellValues.SharedString: // Handle the case break; }

becomes:

C#

if (theCell.DataType.Value == CellValues.SharedString) { // Handle the case }

### OpenXmlElementList is now a struct

OpenXmlElementList is now a struct. It still implements IEnumerable<OpenXmlElement> in addition to IReadOnlyList<OpenXmlElement> where available.

Action needed: Because this is a struct, code patterns that may have a null result will now be a OpenXmlElementList? instead. Null checks will be flagged by the compiler and the value itself will need to be unwrapped, such as:

diff

- OpenXmlElementList? slideIds = part?.Presentation?.SlideIdList?.ChildElements;
+ OpenXmlElementList slideIds = part?.Presentation?.SlideIdList?.ChildElements ?? default;

or

diff

- OpenXmlElementList? slideIds = part?.Presentation?.SlideIdList?.ChildElements;
+ OpenXmlElementList slideIds = (part?.Presentation?.SlideIdList?.ChildElements).GetValueOrDefault();

### IdPartPair is now a readonly struct

This type is used to enumerate pairs within a part and caused many unnecessary allocations. This change should be transparent upon recompilation.

Action needed: Because this is now a struct, null handling code will need to be updated.

### OpenXmlPartReader no longer knows about all parts

In previous versions, OpenXmlPartReader knew about about all strongly typed part. In order to reduce coupling required for better AOT scenarios, we now have typed readers for known packages: WordprocessingDocumentPartReader , SpreadsheetDocumentPartReader , and PresentationDocumentPartReader .

Action needed: Replace usage of OpenXmlPartReader with document specific readers if needed. If creating a part reader from a known package, please use the constructors that take an existing OpenXmlPart which will then create the expected strongly typed parts.

### Attributes for schema information have been removed

SchemaAttrAttribute and ChildElementInfoAttribute have been removed from types and the types themselves are no longer present.

Action needed: If these types were required, please engage us on GitHub to identify the best way forward for you.

### OpenXmlPackage.Close has been removed

This did nothing useful besides call .Dispose() , but caused confusion about which should be called. This is now removed with the expectation of calling .Dispose() , preferably with the using pattern.

Action needed: Remove call and ensure package is disposed properly

### OpenXmlPackage.CanSave is now an instance property

This property used to be a static property that was dependent on the framework. Now, it may change per-package instance depending on settings and backing store.

Action needed: Replace usage of static property with instance.

### OpenXmlPackage.PartExtensionProvider has been

### changed

This property provided a dictionary that allowed access to change the extensions used. This is now backed by the IPartExtensionFeature .

Action needed: Replace usage with OpenXmlPackage.Features.GetRequired<IPartExtensionFeature>() .

### Packages with

### MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode.ProcessAllParts now

### actually process all parts

Previously, there was a heuristic to potentially minimize processing if no parts had been loaded. However, this caused scenarios such as ones where someone manually edited the XML to not actually process upon saving. v3.0.0 fixes this behavior and processes all part if this has been opted in.

Action needed: If you only want loaded parts to be processed, change to

MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode.ProcessLoadedPartsOnly

# Custom SDK Features

Article • 11/15/2023

Features in the Open XML SDK are available starting in v2.14.0 that allows for behavior and state to be contained within the document or part and customized without reimplementing the containing package or part. This is accessed via Features property on packages, parts, and elements.

This is an implementation of the strategy pattern that makes it easy to replace behavior on the fly. It is modeled after the request features in ASP.NET Core.

## Feature inheritance

Packages, parts, and elements all have their own feature collection. However, they will also inherit the containing part and package if it is available.

To highlight this, see the test case below:

C#

OpenXmlPackage package = /* Create a package */;

var packageFeature = new PrivateFeature(); package.Features.Set<PrivateFeature>(packageFeature);

var part = package.GetPartById("existingPart"); Assert.Same(part.Features.GetRequired<PrivateFeature>(), package.Features.GetRequired<PrivateFeature>());

part.Features.Set<PrivateFeature>(new()); Assert.NotSame(part.Features.GetRequired<PrivateFeature>(), package.Features.GetRequired<PrivateFeature>());

private sealed class PrivateFeature { }

７ Note

The feature collection on elements is readonly. This is due to memory issues if it is made writeable. If this is needed, please engage on https://github.com/dotnet/open-xml-sdk to let us know your scenario.

## Visualizing Registered Features

The in-box implementations of the IFeatureCollection provide a helpful debug view so you can see what features are available and what their properties/fields are:

## Available Features

The features that are currently available are described below and at what scope they are available:

### IDisposableFeature

This feature allows for registering actions that need to run when a package or a part is destroyed or disposed:

C#

OpenXmlPackage package = GetSomePackage(); package.Features.Get<IDisposableFeature>().Register(() => /* Some action that is called when the package is disposed */);

OpenXmlPart part = GetSomePart(); part.Features.Get<IDisposableFeature>().Register(() => /* Some action that is called when the part is removed or closed */);

Packages and parts will have their own implementations of this feature. Elements will retrieve the feature for their containing part if available.

### IPackageEventsFeature

This feature allows getting event notifications of when a package is changed:

C#

OpenXmlPackage package = GetSomePackage(); package.TryAddPackageEventsFeature();

var feature = package.Features.GetRequired<IPackageEventsFeature>();

７ Note

There may be times when the package is changed but an event is not fired. Not all areas have been identified where it would make sense to raise an event. Please file an issue if you find one.

### IPartEventsFeature

This feature allows getting event notifications of when an event is being created. This is a feature that is added to the part or package:

C#

OpenXmlPart part = GetSomePackage(); package.AddPartEventsFeature();

var feature = part.Features.GetRequired<IPartEventsFeature>();

Generally, assume that there may be a singleton implementation for the events and verify that the part is the correct part.

７ Note

There may be times when the part is changed but an event is not fired. Not all areas have been identified where it would make sense to raise an event. Please file an issue if you find one.

### IPartRootEventsFeature

This feature allows getting event notifications of when a part root is being modified/loaded/created/etc. This is a feature that is added to the part level feature:

C#

OpenXmlPart part = GetSomePart(); part.AddPartRootEventsFeature();

var feature = part.Features.GetRequired<IPartRootEventsFeature>();

Generally, assume that there may be a singleton implementation for the events and verify that the part is the correct part.

７ Note

There may be times when the part root is changed but an event is not fired. Not all areas have been identified where it would make sense to raise an event. Please file an issue if you find one.

### IRandomNumberGeneratorFeature

This feature allows for a shared service to generate random numbers and fill an array.

### IParagraphIdGeneratorFeature

This feature allows for population and tracking of elements that contain paragraph ids. By default, this will ensure uniqueness of values and ensure that values that do exist are valid per the constraints of the standard. To use this feature:

C#

WordprocessingDocument document = CreateWordDocument(); document.TryAddParagraphIdFeature();

var part = doc.AddMainDocumentPart(); var body = new Body(); part.Document = new Document(body);

var p = new Paragraph(); body.AddChild(p); // After adding p.ParagraphId will be set to a unique, valid value

This feature can also be used to ensure uniqueness among multiple documents with a slight change:

C#

using var doc1 = CreateDocument1(); using var doc2 = CreateDocument2();

var shared = doc1 .AddSharedParagraphIdFeature() .Add(doc2);

// Add item to doc1

var part1 = doc1.AddMainDocumentPart(); var body1 = new Body(); var p1 = new Paragraph(); part1.Document = new Document(body1); body1.AddChild(p1);

// Add item with same ID to doc2 var part2 = doc2.AddMainDocumentPart(); var body2 = new Body(); var p2 = new Paragraph { ParagraphId = p1.ParagraphId }; part2.Document = new Document(body2); body2.AddChild(p2);

// Assert Assert.NotEqual(p1.ParagraphId, p2.ParagraphId); Assert.Equal(2, shared.Count);

### IPartRootXElementFeature

This feature allows operating on an OpenXmlPart by using XLinq features and directly manipulating XElement nodes.

C#

OpenXmlPart part = GetSomePart();

var node = new(W.document, new XAttribute(XNamespace.Xmlns + "w", W.w), new XElement(W.body, new XElement(W.p, new XElement(W.r, new XElement(W.t, "Hello World!")))));

part.SetXElement(node);

This XElement is cached but will be kept in sync with the underlying part if it were to change.

# Introduction to markup compatibility

Article • 01/08/2025

This topic introduces the markup compatibility features included in the Open XML SDK for Office.

## Introduction

Suppose you have a Microsoft Word 365 document that employs a feature introduced in Microsoft Office 365. When you open that document in Microsoft Word 2016, an earlier version, what should happen? Ideally, you want the document to remain interoperable with Word 2016, even though Word 2016 will not understand the new feature.

Consider also what should happen if you open that document in a hypothetical later version of Office. Here too, you want the document to work as expected. That is, you want the later version of Office to understand and support a feature employed in a document produced by Word 365.

Open XML anticipates these scenarios. The Office Open XML File Formats specification describes facilities for achieving the above desired outcomes in ECMA-376, Second Edition, Part 3 - Markup Compatibility and Extensibility .

The Open XML SDK supports markup compatibility in a way that makes it easy for you to achieve the above desired outcomes for and Office 365 without having to necessarily become an expert in the specification details.

## What is markup compatibility?

Open XML defines formats for word-processing, spreadsheet and presentation documents in the form of specific markup languages, namely WordprocessingML, SpreadsheetML, and PresentationML. With respect to the Open XML file formats, markup compatibility is the ability for a document expressed in one of the above markup languages to facilitate interoperability between applications, or versions of an application, with different feature sets. This is supported through the use of a defined set of XML elements and attributes in the Markup Compatibility namespace of the Open XML specification. Notice that while the markup is supported in the document format, markup producers and consumers, such as Microsoft Word, must support it as well. In other words, interoperability is a function of support both in the file format and by applications.

## Markup compatibility in the Open XML file

## formats specification

Markup compatibility is discussed in ECMA-376, Second Edition, Part 3 - Markup Compatibility and Extensibility , which is recommended reading to understand markup compatibility. The specification defines XML attributes to express compatibility rules, and XML elements to specify alternate content. For example, the Ignorable attribute specifies namespaces that can be ignored when they are not understood by the consuming application. Alternate-Content elements specify markup alternatives that can be chosen by an application at run time. For example, Word 2013 can choose only the markup alternative that it recognizes. The complete list of compatibility-rule attributes and alternate-content elements and their details can be found in the specification.

## Open XML SDK support for markup

## compatibility

The work that the Open XML SDK does for markup compatibility is detailed and subtle. However, the goal can be summarized as: using settings that you assign when you open a document, preprocess the document to:

1. Filter or remove any elements from namespaces that will not be understood (for example, Office 365 document opened in Office 2016 context)
2. Process any markup compatibility elements and attributes as specified in the Open XML specification.

The preprocessing performed is in accordance with ECMA-376, Second Edition: Part 3.13.

The Open XML SDK support for markup compatibility comes primarily in the form of two classes and in the manner in which content is preprocessed in accordance with ECMA-376, Second Edition. The two classes are OpenSettings and MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings . Use the former to provide settings that apply to SDK behavior overall. Use the latter to supply one part of those settings, specifically those that apply to markup compatibility.

## Set the stage when you open

When you open a document using the Open XML SDK, you have the option of using an overload with a signature that accepts an instance of the OpenSettings class as a parameter. You use the open settings class to provide certain important settings that

govern the behavior of the SDK. One set of settings in particular, stored in the MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings property, determines how markup compatibility elements and attributes are processed. You set the property to an instance of the MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings class prior to opening a document.

The class has the following properties:

ProcessMode - Determines the parts that are preprocessed.

TargetFileFormatVersions - Specifies the context that applies to preprocessing.

By default, documents are not preprocessed. If however you do specify open settings and provide markup compatibility process settings, then the document is preprocessed in accordance with those settings.

The following code example demonstrates how to call the Open method with an instance of the open settings class as a parameter. Notice that the ProcessMode and TargetFileFormatVersions properties are initialized as part of the MarkupCompatiblityProcessSettings constructor.

C#

// Create instance of OpenSettings OpenSettings openSettings = new OpenSettings();

// Add the MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings openSettings.MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings = new MarkupCompatibilityProcessSettings( MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode.ProcessAllParts, FileFormatVersions.Office2007);

// Open the document with OpenSettings using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filename, true, openSettings)) { // ... more code here }

## What happens during preprocessing

During preprocessing, the Open XML SDK removes elements and attributes in the markup compatibility namespace, removing the contents of unselected alternate- content elements, and interpreting compatibility-rule attributes as appropriate. This work is guided by the process mode and target file format versions properties.

The ProcessMode property determines the parts to be preprocessed. The content in those parts is filtered to contain only elements that are understood by the application version indicated in the TargetFileFormatVersions property.

２ Warning

Preprocessing affects what gets saved. When you save a file, the only markup that is saved is that which remains after preprocessing.

## Understand process mode

The process mode specifies which document parts should be preprocessed. You set this property to a member of the MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode enumeration. The default value, NoProcess , indicates that no preprocessing is performed. Your application must be able to understand and handle any elements and attributes present in the document markup, including any of the elements and attributes in the Markup Compatibility namespace.

You might want to work on specific document parts while leaving the rest untouched. For example, you might want to ensure minimal modification to the file. In that case, specify ProcessLoadedPartsOnly for the process mode. With this setting, preprocessing and the associated filtering is only applied to the loaded document parts, not the entire document.

Finally, there is ProcessAllParts , which specifies what the name implies. When you choose this value, the entire document is preprocessed.

## Set the target file format version

The target file format versions property lets you choose to process markup compatibility content in the context of a specific Office version, e.g. Office 365. Set the TargetFileFormatVersions property to a member of the FileFormatVersions enumeration.

The default value, Office2007 , means the SDK will assume that namespaces defined in Office 2007 are understood, but not namespaces defined in Office 2010 or later. Thus, during preprocessing, the SDK will ignore the namespaces defined in newer Office versions and choose the Office 2007 compatible alternate-content.

When you set the target file format versions property to Office2013 , the Open XML SDK assumes that all of the namespaces defined in Office 2010 and Office 2013 are understood, does not ignore any content defined under Office 2013, and will choose the Office 2013 compatible alternate-content.

# Add a new document part that receives

# a relationship ID to a package

Article • 03/26/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to add a document part (file) that receives a relationship Id parameter for a word processing document.

## Packages and Document Parts

An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by ISO/IEC 29500 . The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t>

</w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document , body , p , r , and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code, in this how-to, starts by passing in a parameter that represents the path to the Word document. It then creates a new WordprocessingDocument object within a using statement.

C#

C#

static void AddNewPart(string document) { // Create a new word processing document.

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Create(document, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document))

It then adds the MainDocumentPart part in the new word processing document, with the relationship ID, rId1. It also adds the CustomFilePropertiesPart part and a CoreFilePropertiesPart in the new word processing document.

C#

C#

// Add the MainDocumentPart part in the new word processing document. MainDocumentPart mainDocPart = wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocPart.Document = new Document();

// Add the CustomFilePropertiesPart part in the new word processing document. var customFilePropPart = wordDoc.AddCustomFilePropertiesPart(); customFilePropPart.Properties = new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.CustomProperties.Properties();

// Add the CoreFilePropertiesPart part in the new word processing document. var coreFilePropPart = wordDoc.AddCoreFilePropertiesPart(); using (XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter(coreFilePropPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create), System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)) { writer.WriteRaw(""" <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core- properties" /> """); writer.Flush(); }

The code then adds the DigitalSignatureOriginPart part, the ExtendedFilePropertiesPart part, and the ThumbnailPart part in the new word processing document with realtionship IDs rId4, rId5, and rId6.

７ Note

The AddNewPart method creates a relationship from the current document part to the new document part. This method returns the new document part. Also, you can

use the <DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.DataPart.FeedData*> method to fill the document part.

## Sample Code

The following code, adds a new document part that contains custom XML from an external file and then populates the document part. Below is the complete code example in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void AddNewPart(string document) { // Create a new word processing document. using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Create(document, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document)) { // Add the MainDocumentPart part in the new word processing document. MainDocumentPart mainDocPart = wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocPart.Document = new Document();

// Add the CustomFilePropertiesPart part in the new word processing document. var customFilePropPart = wordDoc.AddCustomFilePropertiesPart(); customFilePropPart.Properties = new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.CustomProperties.Properties();

// Add the CoreFilePropertiesPart part in the new word processing document. var coreFilePropPart = wordDoc.AddCoreFilePropertiesPart(); using (XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter(coreFilePropPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create), System.Text.Encoding.UTF8)) { writer.WriteRaw(""" <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core- properties" /> """); writer.Flush(); } // Add the DigitalSignatureOriginPart part in the new word processing document. wordDoc.AddNewPart<DigitalSignatureOriginPart>("rId4");

// Add the ExtendedFilePropertiesPart part in the new word processing document. var extendedFilePropPart = wordDoc.AddNewPart<ExtendedFilePropertiesPart>("rId5"); extendedFilePropPart.Properties = new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.ExtendedProperties.Properties();

// Add the ThumbnailPart part in the new word processing document. wordDoc.AddNewPart<ThumbnailPart>("image/jpeg", "rId6"); } }

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to add a document part (file) to a word processing document programmatically.

## Packages and Document Parts

An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by ISO/IEC 29500 . The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Get a WordprocessingDocument object

The code starts with opening a package file by passing a file name to one of the overloaded Open methods of the WordprocessingDocument that takes a string and a Boolean value that specifies whether the file should be opened for editing or for read- only access. In this case, the Boolean value is true specifying that the file should be opened in read/write mode.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is

automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## How the sample code works

After opening the document for editing, in the using statement, as a WordprocessingDocument object, the code creates a reference to the MainDocumentPart part and adds a new custom XML part. It then reads the contents of the external file that contains the custom XML and writes it to the CustomXmlPart part.

７ Note

To use the new document part in the document, add a link to the document part in the relationship part for the new part.

C#

C#

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart ?? wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart();

CustomXmlPart myXmlPart = mainPart.AddCustomXmlPart(CustomXmlPartType.CustomXml);

using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open)) { myXmlPart.FeedData(stream); }

## Sample code

The following code adds a new document part that contains custom XML from an external file and then populates the part. To call the AddCustomXmlPart method in your program, use the following example that modifies a file by adding a new document part to it.

C#

C#

string document = args[0]; string fileName = args[1];

AddNewPart(args[0], args[1]);

７ Note

Before you run the program, change the Word file extension from .docx to .zip, and view the content of the zip file. Then change the extension back to .docx and run the program. After running the program, change the file extension again to .zip and view its content. You will see an extra folder named "customXML." This folder contains the XML file that represents the added part

Following is the complete code example in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void AddNewPart(string document, string fileName) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true)) { MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart ?? wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart();

CustomXmlPart myXmlPart = mainPart.AddCustomXmlPart(CustomXmlPartType.CustomXml);

using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open)) { myXmlPart.FeedData(stream); } } }

The relationship between parts controls the category of the document.

If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object

To open an existing document, instantiate the WordprocessingDocument class as shown in the following two using statements. In the same statement, you open the word processing file with the specified file name by using the Open method, with the Boolean parameter. For the source file that set the parameter to false to open it for read-only access. For the target file, set the parameter to true in order to enable editing the document.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc1 = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fromDocument1, false))

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc2 = WordprocessingDocument.Open(toDocument2, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

The theme part contains information about the color, font, and format of a document. It is defined in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification as follows.

An instance of this part type contains information about a document's theme, which is a combination of color scheme, font scheme, and format scheme (the latter also being referred to as effects). For a WordprocessingML document, the choice of theme affects the color and style of headings, among other things. For a SpreadsheetML document, the choice of theme affects the color and style of cell contents and charts, among other things. For a PresentationML document, the choice of theme affects the formatting of slides, handouts, and notes via the associated master, among other things.

A WordprocessingML or SpreadsheetML package shall contain zero or one Theme part, which shall be the target of an implicit relationship in a Main Document (§11.3.10) or Workbook (§12.3.23) part. A PresentationML package shall contain zero or one Theme part per Handout Master (§13.3.3), Notes Master (§13.3.4), Slide Master (§13.3.10) or Presentation (§13.3.6) part via an implicit relationship.

Example: The following WordprocessingML Main Document part-relationship item contains a relationship to the Theme part, which is stored in the ZIP item theme/theme1.xml:

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId4" Type="https://…/theme" Target="theme/theme1.xml"/> </Relationships>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## How the Sample Code Works

To copy the contents of a document part in an Open XML package to a document part in a different package, the full path of the each word processing document is passed in as a parameter to the CopyThemeContent method. The code then opens both documents as WordprocessingDocument objects, and creates variables that reference the ThemePart parts in each of the packages.

C#

C#

static void CopyThemeContent(string fromDocument1, string toDocument2) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc1 = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fromDocument1, false)) using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc2 = WordprocessingDocument.Open(toDocument2, true)) { ThemePart? themePart1 = wordDoc1?.MainDocumentPart?.ThemePart; ThemePart? themePart2 = wordDoc2?.MainDocumentPart?.ThemePart;

The code then reads the contents of the source ThemePart part by using a StreamReader object and writes to the target ThemePart part by using a StreamWriter.

C#

C#

using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(themePart1.GetStream())) using (StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter(themePart2.GetStream(FileMode.Create))) {

streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd()); }

## Sample Code

The following code copies the contents of one document part in an Open XML package to a document part in a different package. To call the CopyThemeContent method, you can use the following example, which copies the theme part from the packages located at args[0] to one located at args[1] .

C#

C#

string fromDocument1 = args[0]; string toDocument2 = args[1];

CopyThemeContent(fromDocument1, toDocument2);

） Important

Before you run the program, make sure that the source document has the theme part set. To add a theme to a document, open it in Microsoft Word, click the Design tab then click Themes, and select one of the available themes.

After running the program, you can inspect the file to see the changed theme.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void CopyThemeContent(string fromDocument1, string toDocument2) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc1 = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fromDocument1, false)) using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc2 = WordprocessingDocument.Open(toDocument2, true)) { ThemePart? themePart1 = wordDoc1?.MainDocumentPart?.ThemePart;

ThemePart? themePart2 = wordDoc2?.MainDocumentPart?.ThemePart;

// If the theme parts are null, then there is nothing to copy. if (themePart1 is null || themePart2 is null) { return; } using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(themePart1.GetStream())) using (StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter(themePart2.GetStream(FileMode.Create))) { streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd()); } } }

# Create a package

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically create a word processing document package from content in the form of WordprocessingML XML markup.

## Packages and Document Parts

An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by ISO/IEC 29500 . The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the WordprocessingDocument class represents a Word document package. To create a Word document, you create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a main document part that serves as a container for the main text of the document. The text is represented in the package as XML using WordprocessingML markup.

To create the class instance you call Create(String, WordprocessingDocumentType). Several Create methods are provided, each with a different signature. The first parameter takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to create. The second parameter is a member of the WordprocessingDocumentType enumeration. This parameter represents the type of document. For example, there is a different member of the WordprocessingDocumentType enumeration for each of document, template, and the macro enabled variety of document and template.

７ Note

Carefully select the appropriate WordprocessingDocumentType and verify that the persisted file has the correct, matching file extension. If the WordprocessingDocumentType does not match the file extension, an error occurs when you open the file in Microsoft Word.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Create(document, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

Once you have created the Word document package, you can add parts to it. To add the main document part you call AddMainDocumentPart. Having done that, you can set about adding the document structure and text.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body>

<w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Sample Code

The following is the complete code sample that you can use to create an Open XML word processing document package from XML content in the form of WordprocessingML markup.

After you run the program, open the created file and examine its content; it should be one paragraph that contains the phrase "Hello world!"

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// To create a new package as a Word document. static void CreateNewWordDocument(string document) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Create(document, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document)) { // Set the content of the document so that Word can open it. MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart();

SetMainDocumentContent(mainPart); } }

// Set the content of MainDocumentPart. static void SetMainDocumentContent(MainDocumentPart part) { const string docXml = @"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?> <w:document xmlns:w=""http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"" > <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Hello World</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>";

using (Stream stream = part.GetStream()) { byte[] buf = (new UTF8Encoding()).GetBytes(docXml); stream.Write(buf, 0, buf.Length); } }

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to retrieve the contents of a document part in a Wordprocessing document programmatically.

## Packages and Document Parts

An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by ISO/IEC 29500 . The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object

The code starts with opening a package file by passing a file name to one of the overloaded Open methods (Visual Basic .NET Shared method or C# static method) of the WordprocessingDocument class that takes a string and a Boolean value that specifies whether the file should be opened in read/write mode or not. In this case, the Boolean value is false specifying that the file should be opened in read-only mode to avoid accidental changes.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, false))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Comments Element

In this how-to, you are going to work with comments. Therefore, it is useful to familiarize yourself with the structure of the <comments/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification can be useful when working with this element.

This element specifies all of the comments defined in the current document. It is the root element of the comments part of a WordprocessingML document.Consider the following WordprocessingML fragment for the content of a comments part in a WordprocessingML document:

XML

<w:comments> <w:comment … > … </w:comment> </w:comments>

The comments element contains the single comment specified by this document in this example.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML schema fragment defines the contents of this element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_Comments"> <sequence> <element name="comment" type="CT_Comment" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> </sequence> </complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After you have opened the source file for reading, you create a mainPart object by instantiating the MainDocumentPart . Then you can create a reference to the WordprocessingCommentsPart part of the document.

C#

C#

static string GetCommentsFromDocument(string document) { string? comments = null;

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, false)) { if (wordDoc is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(wordDoc)); }

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart ?? wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart(); WordprocessingCommentsPart WordprocessingCommentsPart = mainPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart ?? mainPart.AddNewPart<WordprocessingCommentsPart>();

You can then use a StreamReader object to read the contents of the WordprocessingCommentsPart part of the document and return its contents.

C#

C#

using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(WordprocessingCommentsPart.GetStream())) { comments = streamReader.ReadToEnd(); } }

return comments;

## Sample Code

The following code retrieves the contents of a WordprocessingCommentsPart part contained in a WordProcessing document package. You can run the program by calling the GetCommentsFromDocument method as shown in the following example.

C#

C#

string document = args[0]; GetCommentsFromDocument(document);

Following is the complete code example in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static string GetCommentsFromDocument(string document) { string? comments = null;

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, false)) { if (wordDoc is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(wordDoc)); }

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart ?? wordDoc.AddMainDocumentPart(); WordprocessingCommentsPart WordprocessingCommentsPart =

mainPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart ?? mainPart.AddNewPart<WordprocessingCommentsPart>();

using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(WordprocessingCommentsPart.GetStream())) { comments = streamReader.ReadToEnd(); } }

return comments; }

The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object

The code example starts with opening a package file by passing a file name as an argument to one of the overloaded Open methods of the WordprocessingDocument that takes a string and a Boolean value that specifies whether the file should be opened in read/write mode or not. In this case, the Boolean value is true specifying that the file should be opened in read/write mode.

C#

C#

## Settings Element

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the settings element in a PresentationML package.

This element specifies the settings that are applied to a WordprocessingML document. This element is the root element of the Document Settings part in a WordprocessingML document. Example: Consider the following WordprocessingML fragment for the settings part of a document:

XML

<w:settings> <w:defaultTabStop w:val="720" /> <w:characterSpacingControl w:val="dontCompress" /> </w:settings>

The settings element contains all of the settings for this document. In this case, the two settings applied are automatic tab stop increments of 0.5" using the defaultTabStop element, and no character level white space compression using the characterSpacingControl element.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## How the Sample Code Works

After you have opened the document, in the using statement, as a WordprocessingDocument object, you create a reference to the DocumentSettingsPart part. You can then check if that part exists, if so, delete that part from the package. In this instance, the settings.xml part is removed from the package.

C#

C#

MainDocumentPart? mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;

if (mainPart is not null && mainPart.DocumentSettingsPart is not null) { mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.DocumentSettingsPart); }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete code example in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// To remove a document part from a package. static void RemovePart(string document) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true)) { MainDocumentPart? mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;

if (mainPart is not null && mainPart.DocumentSettingsPart is not null) { mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.DocumentSettingsPart); } } }

## How to Change Theme in a Word Package

If you would like to change the theme in a Word document, click the ribbon Design and then click Themes. The Themes pull-down menu opens. To choose one of the built-in themes and apply it to the Word document, click the theme icon. You can also use the option Browse for Themes... to locate and apply a theme file in your computer.

## The Structure of the Theme Element

The theme element is constituted of color, font, and format schemes. In this how-to you learn how to change the theme programmatically. Therefore, it is useful to familiarize yourself with the theme element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification can be useful when working with this element.

This element defines the root level complex type associated with a shared style sheet (or theme). This element holds all the different formatting options available to a document through a theme, and defines the overall look and feel of the document when themed objects are used within the document.

[Example: Consider the following image as an example of different themes in use applied to a presentation. In this example, you can see how a theme can affect font, colors, backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a presentation. end example]

In this example, we see how a theme can affect font, colors, backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a presentation. end example]

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists the possible child types of the Theme class.

ﾉ Expand table

PresentationML Element Open XML SDK Class Description

<custClrLst/> CustomColorList Custom Color List

<extLst/> ExtensionList Extension List

<extraClrSchemeLst/> ExtraColorSchemeList Extra Color Scheme List

<objectDefaults/> ObjectDefaults Object Defaults

<themeElements/> ThemeElements Theme Elements

The following XML Schema fragment defines the four parts of the theme element. The themeElements element is the piece that holds the main formatting defined within the theme. The other parts provide overrides, defaults, and additions to the information contained in themeElements . The complex type defining a theme, CT_OfficeStyleSheet , is defined in the following manner:

XML

<complexType name="CT_OfficeStyleSheet"> <sequence> <element name="themeElements" type="CT_BaseStyles" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="objectDefaults" type="CT_ObjectStyleDefaults" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="extraClrSchemeLst" type="CT_ColorSchemeList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="custClrLst" type="CT_CustomColorList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="extLst" type="CT_OfficeArtExtensionList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> </sequence> <attribute name="name" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/> </complexType>

This complex type also holds a CT_OfficeArtExtensionList , which is used for future extensibility of this complex type.

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the file, you can instantiate the MainDocumentPart in the wordDoc object, and delete the old theme part.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true)) { if (wordDoc?.MainDocumentPart?.ThemePart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body and/or ThemePart is null."); }

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;

// Delete the old document part. mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.ThemePart);

You can then create add a new ThemePart object and add it to the MainDocumentPart object. Then you add content by using a StreamReader and StreamWriter objects to copy the theme from the themeFile to the ThemePart object.

C#

C#

// Add a new document part and then add content. ThemePart themePart = mainPart.AddNewPart<ThemePart>();

using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(themeFile)) using (StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter(themePart.GetStream(FileMode.Create))) { streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd()); }

## Sample Code

The following code example shows how to replace the theme document part in a word processing document with the theme part from another package. The theme file passed as the second argument must be a valid theme part in XML format (for example,

Theme1.xml). You can extract this part from an existing document or theme file (.THMX) that has been renamed to be a .Zip file. To call the method ReplaceTheme you can use the following call example to copy the theme from the file from arg[1] and to the file located at arg[0]

C#

C#

string document = args[0]; string themeFile = args[1];

ReplaceTheme(document, themeFile);

After you run the program open the Word file and notice the new theme changes.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// This method can be used to replace the theme part in a package. static void ReplaceTheme(string document, string themeFile) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true)) { if (wordDoc?.MainDocumentPart?.ThemePart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body and/or ThemePart is null."); }

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart;

// Delete the old document part. mainPart.DeletePart(mainPart.ThemePart); // Add a new document part and then add content. ThemePart themePart = mainPart.AddNewPart<ThemePart>();

using (StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(themeFile)) using (StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter(themePart.GetStream(FileMode.Create))) { streamWriter.Write(streamReader.ReadToEnd()); }

} }

# Search and replace text in a document

# part

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically search and replace a text value in a word processing document.

## Packages and Document Parts

An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by ISO/IEC 29500 . The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object

In the sample code, you start by opening the word processing file by instantiating the WordprocessingDocument class as shown in the following using statement. In the same statement, you open the word processing file document by using the Open method, with the Boolean parameter set to true to enable editing the document.

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the

WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## Sample Code

The following example demonstrates a quick and easy way to search and replace. It may not be reliable because it retrieves the XML document in string format. Depending on the regular expression you might unintentionally replace XML tags and corrupt the document. If you simply want to search a document, but not replace the contents you can use MainDocumentPart.Document.InnerText .

This example also shows how to use a regular expression to search and replace the text value, "Hello World!" stored in a word processing file with the value "Hi Everyone!". To call the method SearchAndReplace , you can use the following example.

C#

SearchAndReplace(args[0]);

After running the program, you can inspect the file to see the change in the text, "Hello world!"

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static void SearchAndReplace(string document) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true)) { string? docText = null;

if (wordDoc.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream())) { docText = sr.ReadToEnd(); }

Regex regexText = new Regex("Hello World!"); docText = regexText.Replace(docText, "Hi Everyone!");

using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create))) { sw.Write(docText); } } }

As of v3.0, a new abstraction layer was added in between System.IO.Packaging and DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage . This is currently experimental, but can be used if needed. This will be stabilized in a future release, and may or may not require code changes.

## Suppress warnings

It's recommended that you use an available workaround whenever possible. However, if you cannot change your code, you can suppress warnings through a #pragma directive or a <NoWarn> project setting. If you must use the obsolete or experimental APIs and the OOXMLXXXX diagnostic does not surface as an error, you can suppress the warning in code or in your project file.

To suppress the warnings in code:

C#

// Disable the warning. #pragma warning disable OOXML0001

// Code that uses obsolete or experimental API. //...

// Re-enable the warning. #pragma warning restore OOXML0001

To suppress the warnings in a project file:

XML

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> <!-- NoWarn below suppresses SYSLIB0001 project-wide --> <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);OOXML0001</NoWarn> <!-- To suppress multiple warnings, you can use multiple NoWarn elements --> <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);OOXML0001</NoWarn> <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);OTHER_WARNING</NoWarn> <!-- Alternatively, you can suppress multiple warnings by using a semicolon-delimited list --> <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);OOXML0001;OTHER_WARNING</NoWarn> </PropertyGroup> </Project>

７ Note

Suppressing warnings in this way only disables the obsoletion warnings you specify. It doesn't disable any other warnings, including obsoletion warnings with different diagnostic IDs.

# Add an audio file to a slide in a

# presentation

Article • 05/12/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to add an audio file to the last slide in a presentation programmatically.

## Getting a Presentation Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read/write, specify the value true for this parameter as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the file parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(filePath, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case ppt .

## The Structure of the Audio From File

The PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the Picture ( <pic/> ) element.

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

Audio File ( <audioFile/> ) specifies the presence of an audio file. This element is specified within the non-visual properties of an object. The audio shall be attached to an object as this is how it is represented within the document. The actual playing of the audio however is done within the timing node list that is specified under the timing element.

Consider the following Picture object that has an audio file attached to it.

XML

<p:pic> <p:nvPicPr> <p:cNvPr id="7" name="Rectangle 6"> <a:hlinkClick r:id="" action="ppaction://media"/> </p:cNvPr> <p:cNvPicPr> <a:picLocks noRot="1"/> </p:cNvPicPr> <p:nvPr> <a:audioFile r:link="rId1"/> </p:nvPr> </p:nvPicPr> </p:pic>

In the above example, we see that there is a single audioFile element attached to this picture. This picture is placed within the document just as a normal picture or shape would be. The id of this picture, namely 7 in this case, is used to refer to this audioFile element from within the timing node list. The Linked relationship id is used to retrieve the actual audio file for playback purposes.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML Schema fragment defines the contents of audioFile.

XML

<xsd:complexType name="CT_TLMediaNodeAudio"> <xsd:sequence> <xsd:element name="cMediaNode" type="CT_TLCommonMediaNodeData" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> </xsd:sequence> <xsd:attribute name="isNarration" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> </xsd:complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the presentation file for read/write access in the using statement, the code gets the presentation part from the presentation document. Then it gets the relationship ID of the last slide, and gets the slide part from the relationship ID.

C#

C#

//Get presentation part PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

//Get slides ids. OpenXmlElementList slidesIds = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.ChildElements;

//Get relationsipId of the last slide string? audioSlidePartRelationshipId = ((SlideId)slidesIds[slidesIds.ToArray().Length - 1]).RelationshipId;

if (audioSlidePartRelationshipId == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Slide id not found"); }

//Get slide part by relationshipID SlidePart? slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(audioSlidePartRelationshipId);

The code first creates a media data part for the audio file to be added. With the audio file stream open, it feeds the media data part object. Next, audio and media relationship references are added to the slide using the provided embedId for future reference to the audio file and mediaEmbedId for media reference.

An image part is then added with a sample picture to be used as a placeholder for the audio. A picture object is created with various elements, such as Non-Visual Drawing Properties ( <cNvPr/> ), which specify non-visual canvas properties. This allows for additional information that does not affect the appearance of the picture to be stored. The <audioFile/> element, explained above, is also included. The HyperLinkOnClick ( <hlinkClick/> ) element specifies the on-click hyperlink information to be applied to a run of text or image. When the hyperlink text or image is clicked, the link is fetched. Non-Visual Picture Drawing Properties ( <cNvPicPr/> ) specify the non-visual properties for the picture canvas. For a detailed explanation of the elements used, please refer to ISO/IEC 29500

C#

C#

// Create audio Media Data Part (content type, extension) MediaDataPart mediaDataPart = presentationDocument.CreateMediaDataPart("audio/mp3", ".mp3");

//Get the audio file and feed the stream using (Stream mediaDataPartStream = File.OpenRead(audioFilePath)) { mediaDataPart.FeedData(mediaDataPartStream); } //Adds a AudioReferenceRelationship to the MainDocumentPart slidePart.AddAudioReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, embedId);

//Adds a MediaReferenceRelationship to the SlideLayoutPart slidePart.AddMediaReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, mediaEmbedId);

NonVisualDrawingProperties nonVisualDrawingProperties = new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = shapeId, Name = "audio" }; A.AudioFromFile audioFromFile = new A.AudioFromFile() { Link = embedId };

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties appNonVisualDrawingProperties = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(); appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(audioFromFile);

//adds sample image to the slide with id to be used as reference in blip ImagePart imagePart = slidePart.AddImagePart(ImagePartType.Png, imgEmbedId); using (Stream data = File.OpenRead(coverPicPath)) { imagePart.FeedData(data); }

if (slidePart!.Slide!.CommonSlideData!.ShapeTree == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Presentation shape tree is empty"); }

//Getting existing shape tree element from PowerPoint ShapeTree shapeTree = slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData.ShapeTree;

// specifies the existence of a picture within a presentation. // It can have non-visual properties, a picture fill as well as shape properties attached to it. Picture picture = new Picture(); NonVisualPictureProperties nonVisualPictureProperties = new NonVisualPictureProperties();

A.HyperlinkOnClick hyperlinkOnClick = new A.HyperlinkOnClick() { Id = "", Action = "ppaction://media" }; nonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(hyperlinkOnClick);

NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties = new NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties(); A.PictureLocks pictureLocks = new A.PictureLocks() { NoChangeAspect = true };

nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties.Append(pictureLocks);

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList(); ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension() { Uri = "{DAA4B4D4-6D71-4841- 9C94-3DE7FCFB9230}" };

Next the Media(CT_Media) element is created with use of the previously referenced mediaEmbedId(Embedded Picture Reference). The Blip element is also added; this element specifies the existence of an image (binary large image or picture) and contains a reference to the image data. Blip's Embed attribute is used to specify an placeholder image in the Image Part created previously.

C#

C#

P14.Media media = new() { Embed = mediaEmbedId }; media.AddNamespaceDeclaration("p14", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/2010/main");

appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension.Append(media); appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList.Append(appNonVisualDrawingPropertie sExtension); appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionLis t);

nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(nonVisualDrawingProperties); nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties); nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(appNonVisualDrawingProperties);

//Prepare shape properties to display picture BlipFill blipFill = new BlipFill(); A.Blip blip = new A.Blip() { Embed = imgEmbedId };

All other elements such as Offset( <off/> ), Stretch( <stretch/> ), fillRectangle( <fillRect/> ), are appended to the ShapeProperties( <spPr/> ) and ShapeProperties are appended to the Picture element( <pic/> ). Finally the picture element that includes audio is added to the ShapeTree( <sp/> ) of the slide.

Following is the complete sample code that you can use to add audio to the slide.

## Sample Code

C#

C#

AddAudio(args[0], args[1], args[2]);

static void AddAudio(string filePath, string audioFilePath, string coverPicPath) {

string imgEmbedId = "rId4", embedId = "rId3", mediaEmbedId = "rId2"; UInt32Value shapeId = 5; using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(filePath, true)) {

if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart == null || presentationDocument.PresentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Presentation Part is empty or there are no slides in it"); }

//Get presentation part PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

//Get slides ids. OpenXmlElementList slidesIds = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.ChildElements;

//Get relationsipId of the last slide string? audioSlidePartRelationshipId = ((SlideId)slidesIds[slidesIds.ToArray().Length - 1]).RelationshipId;

if (audioSlidePartRelationshipId == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Slide id not found"); }

//Get slide part by relationshipID SlidePart? slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(audioSlidePartRelationshipId);

// Create audio Media Data Part (content type, extension) MediaDataPart mediaDataPart = presentationDocument.CreateMediaDataPart("audio/mp3", ".mp3");

//Get the audio file and feed the stream using (Stream mediaDataPartStream = File.OpenRead(audioFilePath))

{ mediaDataPart.FeedData(mediaDataPartStream); } //Adds a AudioReferenceRelationship to the MainDocumentPart slidePart.AddAudioReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, embedId);

//Adds a MediaReferenceRelationship to the SlideLayoutPart slidePart.AddMediaReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, mediaEmbedId);

NonVisualDrawingProperties nonVisualDrawingProperties = new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = shapeId, Name = "audio" }; A.AudioFromFile audioFromFile = new A.AudioFromFile() { Link = embedId };

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties appNonVisualDrawingProperties = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(); appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(audioFromFile);

//adds sample image to the slide with id to be used as reference in blip ImagePart imagePart = slidePart.AddImagePart(ImagePartType.Png, imgEmbedId); using (Stream data = File.OpenRead(coverPicPath)) { imagePart.FeedData(data); }

if (slidePart!.Slide!.CommonSlideData!.ShapeTree == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Presentation shape tree is empty"); }

// specifies the existence of a picture within a presentation. // It can have non-visual properties, a picture fill as well as shape properties attached to it. Picture picture = new Picture(); NonVisualPictureProperties nonVisualPictureProperties = new NonVisualPictureProperties();

A.HyperlinkOnClick hyperlinkOnClick = new A.HyperlinkOnClick() { Id = "", Action = "ppaction://media" }; nonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(hyperlinkOnClick);

NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties = new NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties(); A.PictureLocks pictureLocks = new A.PictureLocks() { NoChangeAspect = true }; nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties.Append(pictureLocks);

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList = new

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList(); ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension() { Uri = "{DAA4B4D4-6D71-4841- 9C94-3DE7FCFB9230}" };

P14.Media media = new() { Embed = mediaEmbedId }; media.AddNamespaceDeclaration("p14", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/2010/main");

appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension.Append(media);

appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList.Append(appNonVisualDrawingPropertie sExtension);

appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionLis t);

nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(nonVisualDrawingProperties); nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties); nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(appNonVisualDrawingProperties);

//Prepare shape properties to display picture BlipFill blipFill = new BlipFill(); A.Blip blip = new A.Blip() { Embed = imgEmbedId };

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in

separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

ﾉ Expand table

PresentationMLOpen XML SDKDescription ElementClass

<sld/> Slide Presentation Slide. It is the root element of SlidePart.

<sldLayout/> SlideLayout Slide Layout. It is the root element of SlideLayoutPart.

PresentationMLOpen XML SDKDescription ElementClass

<sldMaster/> SlideMaster Slide Master. It is the root element of SlideMasterPart.

<notesMaster/> NotesMaster Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root element of NotesMasterPart.

## The Structure of the Modern Comment Element

The following XML element specifies a single comment. It contains the text of the comment ( t ) and attributes referring to its author ( authorId ), date time created ( created ), and comment id ( id ).

XML

<p188:cm id="{62A8A96D-E5A8-4BFC-B993-A6EAE3907CAD}" authorId="{CD37207E- 7903-4ED4-8AE8-017538D2DF7E}" created="2024-12-30T20:26:06.503"> <p188:txBody> <a:bodyPr/> <a:lstStyle/> <a:p> <a:r> <a:t>Needs more cowbell</a:t> </a:r> </a:p> </p188:txBody> </p188:cm>

The following tables list the definitions of the possible child elements and attributes of the cm (comment) element. For the complete definition see MS-PPTX 2.16.3.3 CT_Comment

ﾉ Expand table

Attribute Definition

id Specifies the ID of a comment or a comment reply.

authorId Specifies the author ID of a comment or a comment reply.

Child Element Definition

pc:sldMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the slide to which the comment is anchored.

ac:deMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the drawing element to which the comment is anchored.

ac:txMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the text character range to which the comment is anchored.

unknownAnchor Specifies an unknown anchor to which the comment is anchored.

pos Specifies the position of the comment, relative to the top-left corner of the first object to which the comment is anchored.

replyLst Specifies the list of replies to the comment.

txBody Specifies the text of a comment or a comment reply.

extLst Specifies a list of extensions for a comment or a comment reply.

The following XML schema example defines the members of the cm element in addition to the required and optional attributes.

XML

<xsd:complexType name="CT_Comment"> <xsd:sequence> <xsd:group ref="EG_CommentAnchor" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:element name="pos" type="a:CT_Point2D" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:element name="replyLst" type="CT_CommentReplyList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:group ref="EG_CommentProperties" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> </xsd:sequence> <xsd:attributeGroup ref="AG_CommentProperties"/> <xsd:attribute name="startDate" type="xsd:dateTime" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="dueDate" type="xsd:dateTime" use="optional"/>

<xsd:attribute name="assignedTo" type="ST_AuthorIdList" use="optional" default=""/> <xsd:attribute name="complete" type="s:ST_PositiveFixedPercentage" default="0%" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="title" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/> </xsd:complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code opens the presentation document in the using statement. Then it instantiates the CommentAuthorsPart, and verifies that there is an existing comment authors part. If there is not, it adds one.

C#

C#

// create missing PowerPointAuthorsPart if it is null if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart is null) {

presentationDocument.PresentationPart.AddNewPart<PowerPointAuthorsPart> (); }

The code determines whether there is an existing PowerPoint author part in the presentation part; if not, it adds one, then checks if there is an authors list and adds one if it is missing. It also verifies that the author that is passed in is on the list of existing authors; if so, it assigns the existing author ID. If not, it adds a new author to the list of authors and assigns an author ID and the parameter values.

C#

C#

// Add missing AuthorList if it is null if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart!.AuthorList is null) { presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart.AuthorList = new AuthorList(); }

// Get the author or create a new one Author? author =

presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart.AuthorList .ChildElements.OfType<Author>().Where(a => a.Name?.Value == name).FirstOrDefault();

if (author is null) { string authorId = string.Concat("{", Guid.NewGuid(), "}"); string userId = string.Concat(name.Split(" ").FirstOrDefault() ?? "user", "@example.com::", Guid.NewGuid()); author = new Author() { Id = authorId, Name = name, Initials = initials, UserId = userId, ProviderId = string.Empty };

presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart.AuthorList.AppendChild (author); }

Next the code determines if there is a slide id and returns if one does not exist

C#

C#

// Get the Id of the slide to add the comment to SlideId? slideId = presentationDocument.PresentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList?.Elements <SlideId>()?.FirstOrDefault();

// If slideId is null, there are no slides, so return if (slideId is null) return;

In the segment below, the code gets the relationship ID. If it exists, it is used to find the slide part otherwise the first slide in the slide parts enumerable is taken. Then it verifies that there is a PowerPoint comments part for the slide and if not adds one.

C#

C#

// Get the relationship id of the slide if it exists string? relId = slideId.RelationshipId;

// Use the relId to get the slide if it exists, otherwise take the first slide in the sequence SlidePart slidePart = relId is not null ? (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(relId) : presentationDocument.PresentationPart.SlideParts.First();

// If the slide part has comments parts take the first PowerPointCommentsPart // otherwise add a new one PowerPointCommentPart powerPointCommentPart = slidePart.commentParts.FirstOrDefault() ?? slidePart.AddNewPart<PowerPointCommentPart>();

Below the code creates a new modern comment then adds a comment list to the PowerPoint comment part if one does not exist and adds the comment to that comment list.

C#

C#

// Create the comment using the new modern comment class DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office2021.PowerPoint.Comment.Comment DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office2021.PowerPoint.Comment.Comment comment = new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office2021.PowerPoint.Comment.Comment( new SlideMonikerList( new DocumentMoniker(), new SlideMoniker() { CId = cid, SldId = slideId.Id, }), new TextBodyType( new BodyProperties(), new ListStyle(), new Paragraph(new Run(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Text(text))))) { Id = string.Concat("{", Guid.NewGuid(), "}"), AuthorId = author.Id, Created = DateTime.Now, };

// If the comment list does not exist, add one. powerPointCommentPart.CommentList ??= new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office2021.PowerPoint.Comment.CommentList(); // Add the comment to the comment list powerPointCommentPart.CommentList.AppendChild(comment);

With modern comments the slide needs to have the correct extension list and extension. The following code determines if the slide already has a SlideExtensionList and SlideExtension and adds them to the slide if they are not present.

C#

C#

// Get the presentation extension list if it exists SlideExtensionList? presentationExtensionList = slidePart.Slide.ChildElements.OfType<SlideExtensionList> ().FirstOrDefault(); // Create a boolean that determines if this is the slide's first comment bool isFirstComment = false;

// If the presentation extension list is null, add one and set this as the first comment for the slide if (presentationExtensionList is null) { isFirstComment = true; slidePart.Slide.AppendChild(new SlideExtensionList()); presentationExtensionList = slidePart.Slide.ChildElements.OfType<SlideExtensionList>().First(); }

// Get the slide extension if it exists SlideExtension? presentationExtension = presentationExtensionList.ChildElements.OfType<SlideExtension> ().FirstOrDefault();

// If the slide extension is null, add it and set this as a new comment if (presentationExtension is null) { isFirstComment = true; presentationExtensionList.AddChild(new SlideExtension() { Uri = " {6950BFC3-D8DA-4A85-94F7-54DA5524770B}" }); presentationExtension = presentationExtensionList.ChildElements.OfType<SlideExtension> ().First(); }

// If this is the first comment for the slide add the comment relationship if (isFirstComment) { presentationExtension.AddChild(new CommentRelationship() { Id = slidePart.GetIdOfPart(powerPointCommentPart) }); }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete code sample showing how to add a new comment with a new or existing author to a slide with or without existing comments.

７ Note

To get the exact author name and initials, open the presentation file and click the File menu item, and then click Options. The PowerPointOptions window opens and the content of the General tab is displayed. The author name and initials must match the User name and Initials in this tab.

C#

C#

static void AddCommentToPresentation(string file, string initials, string name, string text) { using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(file, true)) { PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument?.PresentationPart ?? throw new MissingFieldException("PresentationPart");

// create missing PowerPointAuthorsPart if it is null if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart is null) {

presentationDocument.PresentationPart.AddNewPart<PowerPointAuthorsPart> (); }

// Add missing AuthorList if it is null if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart!.AuthorList is null) { presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart.AuthorList = new AuthorList(); }

// Get the author or create a new one Author? author = presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart.AuthorList .ChildElements.OfType<Author>().Where(a => a.Name?.Value == name).FirstOrDefault();

if (author is null) { string authorId = string.Concat("{", Guid.NewGuid(), "}"); string userId = string.Concat(name.Split(" ").FirstOrDefault() ?? "user", "@example.com::", Guid.NewGuid()); author = new Author() { Id = authorId, Name = name, Initials = initials, UserId = userId, ProviderId = string.Empty };

presentationDocument.PresentationPart.authorsPart.AuthorList.AppendChild (author); }

// Get the Id of the slide to add the comment to SlideId? slideId = presentationDocument.PresentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList?.Elements <SlideId>()?.FirstOrDefault();

// If slideId is null, there are no slides, so return if (slideId is null) return; Random ran = new Random(); UInt32Value cid = Convert.ToUInt32(ran.Next(100000000, 999999999));

// Get the relationship id of the slide if it exists string? relId = slideId.RelationshipId;

// Use the relId to get the slide if it exists, otherwise take the first slide in the sequence SlidePart slidePart = relId is not null ? (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(relId) : presentationDocument.PresentationPart.SlideParts.First();

# Reply to a comment in a presentation

10/16/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to reply to existing comments in a presentation programmatically.

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly- typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld , sldLayout , sldMaster , and notesMaster elements.

ﾉ Expand table

PresentationMLOpen XML SDKDescription ElementClass

<sld/> Slide Presentation Slide. It is the root element of SlidePart.

<sldLayout/> SlideLayout Slide Layout. It is the root element of SlideLayoutPart.

<sldMaster/> SlideMaster Slide Master. It is the root element of SlideMasterPart.

<notesMaster/> NotesMaster Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root element of NotesMasterPart.

## The Structure of the Modern Comment Element

The following XML element specifies a single comment. It contains the text of the comment ( t ) and attributes referring to its author ( authorId ), date time created ( created ), and comment id ( id ).

XML

<p188:cm id="{62A8A96D-E5A8-4BFC-B993-A6EAE3907CAD}" authorId="{CD37207E-7903- 4ED4-8AE8-017538D2DF7E}" created="2024-12-30T20:26:06.503"> <p188:txBody> <a:bodyPr/> <a:lstStyle/> <a:p> <a:r> <a:t>Needs more cowbell</a:t> </a:r> </a:p> </p188:txBody> </p188:cm>

The following tables list the definitions of the possible child elements and attributes of the cm (comment) element. For the complete definition see MS-PPTX 2.16.3.3 CT_Comment

ﾉ Expand table

Attribute Definition

id Specifies the ID of a comment or a comment reply.

authorId Specifies the author ID of a comment or a comment reply.

status Specifies the status of a comment or a comment reply.

created Specifies the date time when the comment or comment reply is created.

startDate Specifies start date of the comment.

dueDate Specifies due date of the comment.

assignedTo Specifies a list of authors to whom the comment is assigned.

complete Specifies the completion percentage of the comment.

title Specifies the title for a comment.

ﾉ Expand table

Child Element Definition

pc:sldMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the slide to which the comment is anchored.

ac:deMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the drawing element to which the comment is anchored.

Child Element Definition

ac:txMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the text character range to which the comment is anchored.

unknownAnchor Specifies an unknown anchor to which the comment is anchored.

pos Specifies the position of the comment, relative to the top-left corner of the first object to which the comment is anchored.

replyLst Specifies the list of replies to the comment.

txBody Specifies the text of a comment or a comment reply.

extLst Specifies a list of extensions for a comment or a comment reply.

The following XML schema example defines the members of the cm element in addition to the required and optional attributes.

XML

<xsd:complexType name="CT_Comment"> <xsd:sequence> <xsd:group ref="EG_CommentAnchor" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:element name="pos" type="a:CT_Point2D" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:element name="replyLst" type="CT_CommentReplyList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:group ref="EG_CommentProperties" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> </xsd:sequence> <xsd:attributeGroup ref="AG_CommentProperties"/> <xsd:attribute name="startDate" type="xsd:dateTime" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="dueDate" type="xsd:dateTime" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="assignedTo" type="ST_AuthorIdList" use="optional" default=""/> <xsd:attribute name="complete" type="s:ST_PositiveFixedPercentage" default="0%" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="title" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/> </xsd:complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code opens the presentation document in the using statement. Then it gets or creates the CommentAuthorsPart, and verifies that there is an existing comment authors part. If there is not, it adds one.

C#

C#

Next the code determines if the author that is passed in is on the list of existing authors; if so, it assigns the existing author ID. If not, it adds a new author to the list of authors and assigns an author ID and the parameter values.

C#

C#

Next the code gets the first slide part and verifies that it exists, then checks if there are any comment parts associated with the slide.

C#

C#

The code then retrieves the comment list and then iterates through each comment in the comment list, displays the comment text to the user, and prompts whether they want to reply to each comment.

C#

C#

When the user chooses to reply to a comment, the code prompts for the reply text, then gets or creates a CommentReplyList for the comment and adds the new reply with the appropriate author information and timestamp.

C#

# Add a video to a slide in a presentation

Article • 05/31/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to add a video to the first slide in a presentation programmatically.

## Getting a Presentation Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read/write, specify the value true for this parameter as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the file parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(filePath, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case ppt .

## The Structure of the Video From File

The PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the Picture ( <pic/> ) element.

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

Video File ( <videoFile/> ) specifies the presence of a video file. It is defined within the non- visual properties of an object. The video shall be attached to an object as this is how it is

represented within the document. The actual playing of the video however is done within the timing node list that is specified under the timing element.

Consider the following Picture object that has a video attached to it.

XML

<p:pic> <p:nvPicPr> <p:cNvPr id="7" name="Rectangle 6"> <a:hlinkClick r:id="" action="ppaction://media"/> </p:cNvPr> <p:cNvPicPr> <a:picLocks noRot="1"/> </p:cNvPicPr> <p:nvPr> <a:videoFile r:link="rId1"/> </p:nvPr> </p:nvPicPr> </p:pic>

In the above example, we see that there is a single videoFile element attached to this picture. This picture is placed within the document just as a normal picture or shape would be. The id of this picture, namely 7 in this case, is used to refer to this videoFile element from within the timing node list. The Linked relationship id is used to retrieve the actual video file for playback purposes.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML Schema fragment defines the contents of videoFile.

XML

<xsd:complexType name="CT_TLMediaNodeVideo"> <xsd:sequence> <xsd:element name="cMediaNode" type="CT_TLCommonMediaNodeData" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> </xsd:sequence> <xsd:attribute name="fullScrn" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> </xsd:complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the presentation file for read/write access in the using statement, the code gets the presentation part from the presentation document. Then it gets the relationship ID of the

last slide, and gets the slide part from the relationship ID.

C#

C#

//Get presentation part PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

//Get slides ids. OpenXmlElementList slidesIds = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.ChildElements;

//Get relationsipId of the last slide string? videoSldRelationshipId = ((SlideId) slidesIds[slidesIds.ToArray().Length - 1]).RelationshipId;

if (videoSldRelationshipId == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Slide id not found"); }

//Get slide part by relationshipID SlidePart? slidePart = (SlidePart) presentationPart.GetPartById(videoSldRelationshipId);

The code first creates a media data part for the video file to be added. With the video file stream open, it feeds the media data part object. Next, video and media relationship references are added to the slide using the provided embedId for future reference to the video file and mediaEmbedId for media reference.

An image part is then added with a sample picture to be used as a placeholder for the video. A picture object is created with various elements, such as Non-Visual Drawing Properties ( <cNvPr/> ), which specify non-visual canvas properties. This allows for additional information that does not affect the appearance of the picture to be stored. The <videoFile/> element, explained above, is also included. The HyperLinkOnClick ( <hlinkClick/> ) element specifies the on-click hyperlink information to be applied to a run of text or image. When the hyperlink text or image is clicked, the link is fetched. Non-Visual Picture Drawing Properties ( <cNvPicPr/> ) specify the non-visual properties for the picture canvas. For a detailed explanation of the elements used, please refer to ISO/IEC 29500

C#

C#

// Create video Media Data Part (content type, extension) MediaDataPart mediaDataPart = presentationDocument.CreateMediaDataPart("video/mp4", ".mp4");

//Get the video file and feed the stream using (Stream mediaDataPartStream = File.OpenRead(videoFilePath)) { mediaDataPart.FeedData(mediaDataPartStream); } //Adds a VideoReferenceRelationship to the MainDocumentPart slidePart.AddVideoReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, embedId);

//Adds a MediaReferenceRelationship to the SlideLayoutPart slidePart.AddMediaReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, mediaEmbedId);

NonVisualDrawingProperties nonVisualDrawingProperties = new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = shapeId, Name = "video" }; A.VideoFromFile videoFromFile = new A.VideoFromFile() { Link = embedId };

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties appNonVisualDrawingProperties = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(); appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(videoFromFile);

//adds sample image to the slide with id to be used as reference in blip ImagePart imagePart = slidePart.AddImagePart(ImagePartType.Png, imgEmbedId); using (Stream data = File.OpenRead(coverPicPath)) { imagePart.FeedData(data); }

if (slidePart!.Slide!.CommonSlideData!.ShapeTree == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Presentation shape tree is empty"); }

//Getting existing shape tree object from PowerPoint ShapeTree shapeTree = slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData.ShapeTree;

// specifies the existence of a picture within a presentation. // It can have non-visual properties, a picture fill as well as shape properties attached to it. Picture picture = new Picture(); NonVisualPictureProperties nonVisualPictureProperties = new NonVisualPictureProperties();

A.HyperlinkOnClick hyperlinkOnClick = new A.HyperlinkOnClick() { Id = "", Action = "ppaction://media" }; nonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(hyperlinkOnClick);

NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties = new NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties(); A.PictureLocks pictureLocks = new A.PictureLocks() { NoChangeAspect = true }; nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties.Append(pictureLocks);

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList(); ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension() { Uri = "{DAA4B4D4-6D71-4841- 9C94-3DE7FCFB9230}" };

Next Media(CT_Media) element is created with use of previously referenced mediaEmbedId(Embedded Picture Reference). The Blip element is also added; this element specifies the existence of an image (binary large image or picture) and contains a reference to the image data. Blip's Embed attribute is used to specify a placeholder image in the Image Part created previously.

C#

C#

P14.Media media = new() { Embed = mediaEmbedId }; media.AddNamespaceDeclaration("p14", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/2010/main");

appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtension.Append(media); appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionList.Append(appNonVisualDrawingPropertie sExtension); appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(appNonVisualDrawingPropertiesExtensionLis t);

nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(nonVisualDrawingProperties); nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(nonVisualPictureDrawingProperties); nonVisualPictureProperties.Append(appNonVisualDrawingProperties);

//Prepare shape properties to display picture BlipFill blipFill = new BlipFill(); A.Blip blip = new A.Blip() { Embed = imgEmbedId };

All other elements such Offset( <off/> ), Stretch( <stretch/> ), FillRectangle( <fillRect/> ), are appended to the ShapeProperties( <spPr/> ) and ShapeProperties are appended to the Picture element( <pic/> ). Finally the picture element that incudes video is added to the ShapeTree( <sp/> ) of the slide.

Following is the complete sample code that you can use to add video to the slide.

## Sample Code

C#

C#

AddVideo(args[0], args[1], args[2]);

static void AddVideo(string filePath, string videoFilePath, string coverPicPath) {

string imgEmbedId = "rId4", embedId = "rId3", mediaEmbedId = "rId2"; UInt32Value shapeId = 5; using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(filePath, true)) {

if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart == null || presentationDocument.PresentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Presentation Part is empty or there are no slides in it"); } //Get presentation part PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

//Get slides ids. OpenXmlElementList slidesIds = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.ChildElements;

//Get relationsipId of the last slide string? videoSldRelationshipId = ((SlideId) slidesIds[slidesIds.ToArray().Length - 1]).RelationshipId;

if (videoSldRelationshipId == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Slide id not found"); }

//Get slide part by relationshipID SlidePart? slidePart = (SlidePart) presentationPart.GetPartById(videoSldRelationshipId);

// Create video Media Data Part (content type, extension) MediaDataPart mediaDataPart = presentationDocument.CreateMediaDataPart("video/mp4", ".mp4");

//Get the video file and feed the stream using (Stream mediaDataPartStream = File.OpenRead(videoFilePath)) { mediaDataPart.FeedData(mediaDataPartStream); } //Adds a VideoReferenceRelationship to the MainDocumentPart

slidePart.AddVideoReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, embedId);

//Adds a MediaReferenceRelationship to the SlideLayoutPart slidePart.AddMediaReferenceRelationship(mediaDataPart, mediaEmbedId);

NonVisualDrawingProperties nonVisualDrawingProperties = new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = shapeId, Name = "video" }; A.VideoFromFile videoFromFile = new A.VideoFromFile() { Link = embedId };

ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties appNonVisualDrawingProperties = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(); appNonVisualDrawingProperties.Append(videoFromFile);

# Apply a theme to a presentation

Article • 12/05/2023

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to apply the theme from one presentation to another presentation programmatically.

## Getting a PresentationDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open(String, Boolean) method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read-only access, specify the value false for this parameter. To open a document for read/write access, specify the value true for this parameter. In the following using statement, two presentation files are opened, the target presentation, to which to apply a theme, and the source presentation, which already has that theme applied. The source presentation file is opened for read-only access, and the target presentation file is opened for read/write access. In this code, the themePresentation parameter is a string that represents the path for the source presentation document, and the presentationFile parameter is a string that represents the path for the target presentation document.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument themeDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(themePresentation, false)) using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) {

The using statement provides a recommended alternative to the typical .Open, .Save, .Close sequence. It ensures that the Dispose method (internal method used by the Open XML SDK to clean up resources) is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case themeDocument and presentationDocument.

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation namespace.

## Structure of the Theme Element

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification can be useful when working with this element.

This element defines the root level complex type associated with a shared style sheet (or theme). This element holds all the different formatting options available to a document through a theme, and defines the overall look and feel of the document when themed objects are used within the document. [Example: Consider the

following image as an example of different themes in use applied to a presentation. In this example, you can see how a theme can affect font, colors, backgrounds, fills, and effects for different objects in a presentation. end example]

The following XML Schema fragment defines the four parts of the theme element. The themeElements element is the piece that holds the main formatting defined within the theme. The other parts provide overrides, defaults, and additions to the information contained in themeElements. The complex type defining a theme, CT_OfficeStyleSheet, is defined in the following manner.

XML

<complexType name="CT_OfficeStyleSheet"> <sequence> <element name="themeElements" type="CT_BaseStyles" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="objectDefaults" type="CT_ObjectStyleDefaults" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="extraClrSchemeLst" type="CT_ColorSchemeList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="custClrLst" type="CT_CustomColorList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="extLst" type="CT_OfficeArtExtensionList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> </sequence> <attribute name="name" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/> </complexType>

This complex type also holds a CT_OfficeArtExtensionList, which is used for future extensibility of this complex type.

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code consists of two overloads of the method ApplyThemeToPresentation, and the GetSlideLayoutType method. The following code segment shows the first overloaded method, in which the two presentation files, themePresentation and presentationFile, are opened and passed to the second overloaded method as parameters.

C#

C#

// Apply a new theme to the presentation. static void ApplyThemeToPresentation(string presentationFile, string themePresentation) { using (PresentationDocument themeDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(themePresentation, false)) using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) { ApplyThemeToPresentationDocument(presentationDocument, themeDocument); } }

In the second overloaded method, the code starts by checking whether any of the presentation files is empty, in which case it throws an exception. The code then gets the presentation part of the presentation document by declaring a PresentationPart object and setting it equal to the presentation part of the target PresentationDocument object passed in. It then gets the slide master parts from the presentation parts of both objects passed in, and gets the relationship ID of the slide master part of the target presentation.

C#

// Apply a new theme to the presentation. static void ApplyThemeToPresentationDocument(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, PresentationDocument themeDocument) { // Get the presentation part of the presentation document. PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart ?? presentationDocument.AddPresentationPart();

// Get the existing slide master part. SlideMasterPart slideMasterPart = presentationPart.SlideMasterParts.ElementAt(0);

string relationshipId = presentationPart.GetIdOfPart(slideMasterPart);

// Get the new slide master part. PresentationPart themeDocPresentationPart = themeDocument.PresentationPart ?? themeDocument.AddPresentationPart(); SlideMasterPart newSlideMasterPart = themeDocPresentationPart.SlideMasterParts.ElementAt(0);

The code then removes the existing theme part and the slide master part from the target presentation. By reusing the old relationship ID, it adds the new slide master part from the source presentation to the target presentation. It also adds the theme part to the target presentation.

C#

C#

if (presentationPart.ThemePart is not null) {

// Remove the existing theme part. presentationPart.DeletePart(presentationPart.ThemePart); }

// Remove the old slide master part. presentationPart.DeletePart(slideMasterPart);

// Import the new slide master part, and reuse the old relationship ID. newSlideMasterPart = presentationPart.AddPart(newSlideMasterPart, relationshipId);

if (newSlideMasterPart.ThemePart is not null) { // Change to the new theme part. presentationPart.AddPart(newSlideMasterPart.ThemePart); }

The code iterates through all the slide layout parts in the slide master part and adds them to the list of new slide layouts. It specifies the default layout type. For this example, the code for the default layout type is "Title and Content".

C#

C#

Dictionary<string, SlideLayoutPart> newSlideLayouts = new Dictionary<string, SlideLayoutPart>();

foreach (var slideLayoutPart in newSlideMasterPart.SlideLayoutParts) { string? newLayoutType = GetSlideLayoutType(slideLayoutPart);

if (newLayoutType is not null) { newSlideLayouts.Add(newLayoutType, slideLayoutPart); } }

string? layoutType = null; SlideLayoutPart? newLayoutPart = null;

// Insert the code for the layout for this example. string defaultLayoutType = "Title and Content";

The code iterates through all the slide parts in the target presentation and removes the slide layout relationship on all slides. It uses the GetSlideLayoutType method to find the layout type of the slide layout part. For any slide with an existing slide layout part, it

adds a new slide layout part of the same type it had previously. For any slide without an existing slide layout part, it adds a new slide layout part of the default type.

C#

C#

// Remove the slide layout relationship on all slides. foreach (var slidePart in presentationPart.SlideParts) { layoutType = null;

if (slidePart.SlideLayoutPart is not null) { // Determine the slide layout type for each slide. layoutType = GetSlideLayoutType(slidePart.SlideLayoutPart);

// Delete the old layout part. slidePart.DeletePart(slidePart.SlideLayoutPart); }

if (layoutType is not null && newSlideLayouts.TryGetValue(layoutType, out newLayoutPart)) { // Apply the new layout part. slidePart.AddPart(newLayoutPart); } else { newLayoutPart = newSlideLayouts[defaultLayoutType];

// Apply the new default layout part. slidePart.AddPart(newLayoutPart); } }

To get the type of the slide layout, the code uses the GetSlideLayoutType method that takes the slide layout part as a parameter, and returns to the second overloaded ApplyThemeToPresentation method a string that represents the name of the slide layout type

C#

C#

// Get the slide layout type. static string? GetSlideLayoutType(SlideLayoutPart slideLayoutPart) {

CommonSlideData? slideData = slideLayoutPart.SlideLayout?.CommonSlideData;

return slideData?.Name; }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete sample code to copy a theme from one presentation to another. To use the program, you must create two presentations, a source presentation with the theme you would like to copy, for example, Myppt9-theme.pptx, and the other one is the target presentation, for example, Myppt9.pptx. You can use the following call in your program to perform the copying.

C#

C#

ApplyThemeToPresentation(args[0], args[1]);

After performing that call you can inspect the file Myppt2.pptx, and you would see the same theme of the file Myppt9-theme.pptx.

C#

C#

} // Apply a new theme to the presentation. static void ApplyThemeToPresentationDocument(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, PresentationDocument themeDocument) { // Get the presentation part of the presentation document. PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart ?? presentationDocument.AddPresentationPart();

# Change the fill color of a shape in a

# presentation

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK to change the fill color of a shape on the first slide in a presentation programmatically.

## Getting a Presentation Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read/write, specify the value true for this parameter as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the file parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument ppt = PresentationDocument.Open(docName, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case ppt .

## The Structure of the Shape Tree

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the Shape Tree ( <spTree/> ) element.

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

This element specifies all shapes within a slide. Contained within here are all the shapes, either grouped or not, that can be referenced on a given slide. As most objects within a slide are shapes, this represents the majority of content within a slide. Text and effects are attached to shapes that are contained within the spTree element.

[Example: Consider the following PresentationML slide

XML

<p:sld> <p:cSld> <p:spTree> <p:nvGrpSpPr> .. </p:nvGrpSpPr> <p:grpSpPr> .. </p:grpSpPr> <p:sp> .. </p:sp> </p:spTree> </p:cSld> .. </p:sld>

In the above example the shape tree specifies all the shape properties for this slide. end example]

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists the child elements of the Shape Tree along with the description of each.

ﾉ Expand table

Element Description

cxnSp Connection Shape

extLst Extension List with Modification Flag

graphicFrame Graphic Frame

grpSp Group Shape

Element Description

grpSpPr Group Shape Properties

nvGrpSpPr Non-Visual Properties for a Group Shape

pic Picture

sp Shape

The following XML Schema fragment defines the contents of this element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_GroupShape"> <sequence> <element name="nvGrpSpPr" type="CT_GroupShapeNonVisual" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="grpSpPr" type="a:CT_GroupShapeProperties" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"> <element name="sp" type="CT_Shape"/> <element name="grpSp" type="CT_GroupShape"/> <element name="graphicFrame" type="CT_GraphicalObjectFrame"/> <element name="cxnSp" type="CT_Connector"/> <element name="pic" type="CT_Picture"/> </choice> <element name="extLst" type="CT_ExtensionListModify" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> </sequence> </complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the presentation file for read/write access in the using statement, the code gets the presentation part from the presentation document. Then it gets the relationship ID of the first slide, and gets the slide part from the relationship ID.

７ Note

The test file must have a shape on the first slide.

C#

C#

// Get the relationship ID of the first slide. PresentationPart presentationPart = ppt.PresentationPart ?? ppt.AddPresentationPart(); presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList ??= new SlideIdList(); SlideId? slideId = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.GetFirstChild<SlideId>();

if (slideId is not null) { string? relId = slideId.RelationshipId;

if (relId is not null) { // Get the slide part from the relationship ID. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(relId);

The code then gets the shape tree that contains the shape whose fill color is to be changed, and gets the first shape in the shape tree. It then gets the shape properties of the shape and the solid fill reference of the shape properties, and assigns a new fill color to the shape. There is no need to explicitly save the file when inside of a using.

C#

C#

// Get or add the shape tree slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData ??= new CommonSlideData();

// Get the shape tree that contains the shape to change. slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData.ShapeTree ??= new ShapeTree();

// Get the first shape in the shape tree. Shape? shape = slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData.ShapeTree.GetFirstChild<Shape>();

if (shape is not null) { // Get or add the shape properties element of the shape. shape.ShapeProperties ??= new ShapeProperties();

// Get or add the fill reference. Drawing.SolidFill? solidFill = shape.ShapeProperties.GetFirstChild<Drawing.SolidFill>();

if (solidFill is null) { shape.ShapeProperties.AddChild(new Drawing.SolidFill()); solidFill =

shape.ShapeProperties.GetFirstChild<Drawing.SolidFill>(); }

// Set the fill color to SchemeColor solidFill!.SchemeColor = new Drawing.SchemeColor() { Val = Drawing.SchemeColorValues.Accent2 }; }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code that you can use to change the fill color of a shape in a presentation.

C#

C#

// Change the fill color of a shape. // The test file must have a shape on the first slide. static void SetPPTShapeColor(string docName) { using (PresentationDocument ppt = PresentationDocument.Open(docName, true)) { // Get the relationship ID of the first slide. PresentationPart presentationPart = ppt.PresentationPart ?? ppt.AddPresentationPart(); presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList ??= new SlideIdList(); SlideId? slideId = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.GetFirstChild<SlideId>();

if (slideId is not null) { string? relId = slideId.RelationshipId;

if (relId is not null) { // Get the slide part from the relationship ID. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(relId); // Get or add the shape tree slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData ??= new CommonSlideData();

// Get the shape tree that contains the shape to change. slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData.ShapeTree ??= new ShapeTree();

// Get the first shape in the shape tree.

Shape? shape = slidePart.Slide.CommonSlideData.ShapeTree.GetFirstChild<Shape>();

if (shape is not null) { // Get or add the shape properties element of the shape. shape.ShapeProperties ??= new ShapeProperties();

// Get or add the fill reference. Drawing.SolidFill? solidFill = shape.ShapeProperties.GetFirstChild<Drawing.SolidFill>();

if (solidFill is null) { shape.ShapeProperties.AddChild(new Drawing.SolidFill()); solidFill = shape.ShapeProperties.GetFirstChild<Drawing.SolidFill>(); }

// Set the fill color to SchemeColor solidFill!.SchemeColor = new Drawing.SchemeColor() { Val = Drawing.SchemeColorValues.Accent2 }; } } } } }

# Create a presentation document by

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK to create a presentation document programmatically.

## Create a Presentation

A presentation file, like all files defined by the Open XML standard, consists of a package file container. This is the file that users see in their file explorer; it usually has a .pptx extension. The package file is represented in the Open XML SDK by the PresentationDocument class. The presentation document contains, among other parts, a presentation part. The presentation part, represented in the Open XML SDK by the PresentationPart class, contains the basic PresentationML definition for the slide presentation. PresentationML is the markup language used for creating presentations. Each package can contain only one presentation part, and its root element must be <presentation/> .

The API calls used to create a new presentation document package are relatively simple. The first step is to call the static Create method of the PresentationDocument class, as shown here in the CreatePresentation procedure, which is the first part of the complete code sample presented later in the article. The CreatePresentation code calls the override of the Create method that takes as arguments the path to the new document and the type of presentation document to be created. The types of presentation documents available in that argument are defined by a PresentationDocumentType enumerated value.

Next, the code calls AddPresentationPart, which creates and returns a PresentationPart . After the PresentationPart class instance is created, a new root element for the presentation is added by setting the Presentation property equal to the instance of the Presentation class returned from a call to the Presentation class constructor.

In order to create a complete, useable, and valid presentation, the code must also add a number of other parts to the presentation package. In the example code, this is taken care of by a call to a utility function named CreatePresentationsParts . That function then calls a number of other utility functions that, taken together, create all the

presentation parts needed for a basic presentation, including slide, slide layout, slide master, and theme parts.

C#

C#

static void CreatePresentation(string filepath) { // Create a presentation at a specified file path. The presentation document type is pptx, by default. using (PresentationDocument presentationDoc = PresentationDocument.Create(filepath, PresentationDocumentType.Presentation)) { PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDoc.AddPresentationPart(); presentationPart.Presentation = new Presentation();

CreatePresentationParts(presentationPart); } }

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create presentation structure and content by using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the names of the classes that correspond to the presentation, slide, slide master, slide layout, and theme elements. The class that corresponds to the theme element is actually part of the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing namespace. Themes are common to all Open XML markup languages.

ﾉ Expand table

PresentationML Element Open XML SDK Class

<presentation/> Presentation

<sld/> Slide

<sldMaster/> SlideMaster

<sldLayout/> SlideLayout

<theme/> Theme

The PresentationML code that follows is the XML in the presentation part (in the file presentation.xml) for a simple presentation that contains two slides.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to delete all of the comments by a specific author in a presentation programmatically.

７ Note

This sample is for PowerPoint modern comments. For classic comments view the archived sample on GitHub .

## Getting a PresentationDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read/write, specify the value true for this parameter as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the fileName parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document, and the author is the user name displayed in the General tab of the PowerPoint Options.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument doc = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case doc .

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst>

<p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly- typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld , sldLayout , sldMaster , and notesMaster elements.

<sldLayout/> SlideLayout Slide Layout. It is the root element of SlideLayoutPart.

<sldMaster/> SlideMaster Slide Master. It is the root element of SlideMasterPart.

<notesMaster/> NotesMaster Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root element of NotesMasterPart.

## The Structure of the Comment Element

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces comments in a presentation package.

A comment is a text note attached to a slide, with the primary purpose of allowing readers of a presentation to provide feedback to the presentation author. Each comment contains an unformatted text string and information about its author, and is attached to a particular location on a slide. Comments can be visible while editing the presentation, but do not appear when a slide show is given. The displaying application decides when to display comments and determines their visual appearance.

## The Structure of the Modern Comment Element

The following XML element specifies a single comment. It contains the text of the comment ( t ) and attributes referring to its author ( authorId ), date time created ( created ), and comment id ( id ).

XML

<p188:cm id="{62A8A96D-E5A8-4BFC-B993-A6EAE3907CAD}" authorId="{CD37207E-7903- 4ED4-8AE8-017538D2DF7E}" created="2024-12-30T20:26:06.503"> <p188:txBody> <a:bodyPr/> <a:lstStyle/> <a:p> <a:r> <a:t>Needs more cowbell</a:t> </a:r> </a:p> </p188:txBody> </p188:cm>

The following tables list the definitions of the possible child elements and attributes of the cm (comment) element. For the complete definition see MS-PPTX 2.16.3.3 CT_Comment

ﾉ Expand table

Attribute Definition

id Specifies the ID of a comment or a comment reply.

authorId Specifies the author ID of a comment or a comment reply.

status Specifies the status of a comment or a comment reply.

created Specifies the date time when the comment or comment reply is created.

startDate Specifies start date of the comment.

dueDate Specifies due date of the comment.

assignedTo Specifies a list of authors to whom the comment is assigned.

complete Specifies the completion percentage of the comment.

title Specifies the title for a comment.

ﾉ Expand table

Child Element Definition

pc:sldMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the slide to which the comment is anchored.

Child Element Definition

ac:deMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the drawing element to which the comment is anchored.

ac:txMkLst Specifies a content moniker that identifies the text character range to which the comment is anchored.

unknownAnchor Specifies an unknown anchor to which the comment is anchored.

pos Specifies the position of the comment, relative to the top-left corner of the first object to which the comment is anchored.

replyLst Specifies the list of replies to the comment.

txBody Specifies the text of a comment or a comment reply.

extLst Specifies a list of extensions for a comment or a comment reply.

The following XML schema example defines the members of the cm element in addition to the required and optional attributes.

XML

<xsd:complexType name="CT_Comment"> <xsd:sequence> <xsd:group ref="EG_CommentAnchor" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:element name="pos" type="a:CT_Point2D" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:element name="replyLst" type="CT_CommentReplyList" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <xsd:group ref="EG_CommentProperties" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/> </xsd:sequence> <xsd:attributeGroup ref="AG_CommentProperties"/> <xsd:attribute name="startDate" type="xsd:dateTime" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="dueDate" type="xsd:dateTime" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="assignedTo" type="ST_AuthorIdList" use="optional" default=""/> <xsd:attribute name="complete" type="s:ST_PositiveFixedPercentage" default="0%" use="optional"/> <xsd:attribute name="title" type="xsd:string" use="optional" default=""/> </xsd:complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the presentation document for read/write access and instantiating the PresentationDocument class, the code gets the specified comment author from the list of comment authors.

C#

C#

// Get the modern comments. IEnumerable<Author>? commentAuthors = doc.PresentationPart?.authorsPart?.AuthorList.Elements<Author>() .Where(x => x.Name is not null && x.Name.HasValue && x.Name.Value!.Equals(author));

By iterating through the matching authors and all the slides in the presentation the code gets all the slide parts, and the comments part of each slide part. It then gets the list of comments by the specified author and deletes each one. It also verifies that the comment part has no existing comment, in which case it deletes that part. It also deletes the comment author from the comment authors part.

C#

C#

// Iterate through all the matching authors. foreach (Author commentAuthor in commentAuthors) { string? authorId = commentAuthor.Id; IEnumerable<SlidePart>? slideParts = doc.PresentationPart?.SlideParts;

// If there's no author ID or slide parts or slide parts, return. if (authorId is null || slideParts is null) { return; }

// Iterate through all the slides and get the slide parts. foreach (SlidePart slide in slideParts) { IEnumerable<PowerPointCommentPart>? slideCommentsParts = slide.commentParts;

// Get the list of comments. if (slideCommentsParts is not null) { IEnumerable<Tuple<PowerPointCommentPart, Comment>> commentsTup = slideCommentsParts .SelectMany(scp => scp.CommentList.Elements<Comment>() .Where(comment => comment.AuthorId is not null && comment.AuthorId == authorId) .Select(c => new Tuple<PowerPointCommentPart, Comment>(scp, c)));

foreach (Tuple<PowerPointCommentPart, Comment> comment in commentsTup) { // Delete all the comments by the specified author. comment.Item1.CommentList.RemoveChild(comment.Item2);

// If the commentPart has no existing comment. if (comment.Item1.CommentList.ChildElements.Count == 0) { // Delete this part. slide.DeletePart(comment.Item1); } }

} }

// Delete the comment author from the authors part. doc.PresentationPart?.authorsPart?.AuthorList.RemoveChild(commentAuthor); }

## Sample Code

The following method takes as parameters the source presentation file name and path and the name of the comment author whose comments are to be deleted. It finds all the comments by the specified author in the presentation and deletes them. It then deletes the comment author from the list of comment authors.

７ Note

To get the exact author's name, open the presentation file and click the File menu item, and then click Options. The PowerPoint Options window opens and the content of the General tab is displayed. The author's name must match the User name in this tab.

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// Remove all the comments in the slides by a certain x. static void DeleteCommentsByAuthorInPresentation(string fileName, string author) { using (PresentationDocument doc = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName,

true)) { // Get the modern comments. IEnumerable<Author>? commentAuthors = doc.PresentationPart?.authorsPart?.AuthorList.Elements<Author>() .Where(x => x.Name is not null && x.Name.HasValue && x.Name.Value!.Equals(author));

if (commentAuthors is null) { return; }

// Iterate through all the matching authors. foreach (Author commentAuthor in commentAuthors) { string? authorId = commentAuthor.Id; IEnumerable<SlidePart>? slideParts = doc.PresentationPart?.SlideParts;

// If there's no author ID or slide parts or slide parts, return. if (authorId is null || slideParts is null) { return; }

// Iterate through all the slides and get the slide parts. foreach (SlidePart slide in slideParts) { IEnumerable<PowerPointCommentPart>? slideCommentsParts = slide.commentParts;

// Get the list of comments. if (slideCommentsParts is not null) { IEnumerable<Tuple<PowerPointCommentPart, Comment>> commentsTup = slideCommentsParts .SelectMany(scp => scp.CommentList.Elements<Comment>() .Where(comment => comment.AuthorId is not null && comment.AuthorId == authorId) .Select(c => new Tuple<PowerPointCommentPart, Comment> (scp, c)));

foreach (Tuple<PowerPointCommentPart, Comment> comment in commentsTup) { // Delete all the comments by the specified author. comment.Item1.CommentList.RemoveChild(comment.Item2);

// If the commentPart has no existing comment. if (comment.Item1.CommentList.ChildElements.Count == 0) { // Delete this part. slide.DeletePart(comment.Item1);

} }

} }

// Delete the comment author from the authors part.

doc.PresentationPart?.authorsPart?.AuthorList.RemoveChild(commentAuthor); } } }

# Delete a slide from a presentation

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the Open XML SDK for Office to delete a slide from a presentation programmatically. It also shows how to delete all references to the slide from any custom shows that may exist. To delete a specific slide in a presentation file you need to know first the number of slides in the presentation. Therefore the code in this how-to is divided into two parts. The first is counting the number of slides, and the second is deleting a slide at a specific index.

Note

Deleting a slide from more complex presentations, such as those that contain outline view settings, for example, may require additional steps.

## Getting a Presentation Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call one of the Open method overloads. The code in this topic uses the Open method, which takes a file path as the first parameter to specify the file to open, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. Set this second parameter to false to open the file for read-only access, or true if you want to open the file for read/write access. The code in this topic opens the file twice, once to count the number of slides and once to delete a specific slide. When you count the number of slides in a presentation, it is best to open the file for read-only access to protect the file against accidental writing. The following using statement opens the file for read-only access. In this code example, the presentationFile parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

// Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false))

To delete a slide from the presentation file, open it for read/write access as shown in the following using statement.

C#

C#

// Open the source document as read/write. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case presentationDocument .

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an

annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

It is the root element of <sldLayout/> SlideLayout SlideLayoutPart. Slide Master. It is the root element of <sldMaster/> SlideMaster SlideMasterPart. Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root <notesMaster/> NotesMaster element of NotesMasterPart.

## Counting the Number of Slides

The sample code consists of two overloads of the CountSlides method. The first overload uses a string parameter and the second overload uses a PresentationDocument parameter. In the first CountSlides method, the sample code opens the presentation document in the using statement. Then it passes the PresentationDocument object to the second CountSlides method, which returns an integer number that represents the number of slides in the presentation.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Pass the presentation to the next CountSlide method // and return the slide count. return CountSlides(presentationDocument);

In the second CountSlides method, the code verifies that the PresentationDocument object passed in is not null , and if it is not, it gets a PresentationPart object from the PresentationDocument object. By using the SlideParts the code gets the slideCount and returns it.

C# Visual Basic

C#

if (presentationDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("presentationDocument"); }

int slidesCount = 0;

// Get the presentation part of document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the slide count from the SlideParts. if (presentationPart is not null) { slidesCount = presentationPart.SlideParts.Count(); }

// Return the slide count to the previous method. return slidesCount;

## Deleting a Specific Slide

The code for deleting a slide uses two overloads of the DeleteSlide method. The first overloaded DeleteSlide method takes two parameters: a string that represents the presentation file name and path, and an integer that represents the zero-based index position of the slide to delete. It opens the presentation file for read/write access, gets a PresentationDocument object, and then passes that object and the index number to the next overloaded DeleteSlide method, which performs the deletion.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get the presentation object and pass it to the next DeleteSlide method. static void DeleteSlide(string presentationFile, int slideIndex) { // Open the source document as read/write. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) { // Pass the source document and the index of the slide to be deleted to the next DeleteSlide method. DeleteSlide(presentationDocument, slideIndex); } }

The first section of the second overloaded DeleteSlide method uses the CountSlides method to get the number of slides in the presentation. Then, it gets the list of slide IDs in the presentation, identifies the specified slide in the slide list, and removes the slide from the slide list.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Delete the specified slide from the presentation. static void DeleteSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int slideIndex) { if (presentationDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(presentationDocument)); }

// Use the CountSlides sample to get the number of slides in the presentation. int slidesCount = CountSlides(presentationDocument);

if (slideIndex < 0 || slideIndex >= slidesCount) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("slideIndex"); }

// Get the presentation part from the presentation document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the presentation from the presentation part. Presentation? presentation = presentationPart?.Presentation;

// Get the list of slide IDs in the presentation. SlideIdList? slideIdList = presentation?.SlideIdList;

// Get the slide ID of the specified slide SlideId? slideId = slideIdList?.ChildElements[slideIndex] as SlideId;

// Get the relationship ID of the slide. string? slideRelId = slideId?.RelationshipId;

// If there's no relationship ID, there's no slide to delete. if (slideRelId is null) { return; }

// Remove the slide from the slide list. slideIdList!.RemoveChild(slideId);

The next section of the second overloaded DeleteSlide method removes all references to the deleted slide from custom shows. It does that by iterating through the list of custom shows and through the list of slides in each custom show. It then declares and instantiates a linked list of slide list entries, and finds references to the deleted slide by using the relationship ID of that slide. It adds those references to the list of slide list entries, and then removes each such reference from the slide list of its respective custom show.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Remove references to the slide from all custom shows. if (presentation!.CustomShowList is not null) { // Iterate through the list of custom shows. foreach (var customShow in presentation.CustomShowList.Elements<CustomShow>()) { if (customShow.SlideList is not null) { // Declare a link list of slide list entries. LinkedList<SlideListEntry> slideListEntries = new LinkedList<SlideListEntry>(); foreach (SlideListEntry slideListEntry in customShow.SlideList.Elements()) { // Find the slide reference to remove from the custom show. if (slideListEntry.Id is not null && slideListEntry.Id == slideRelId) { slideListEntries.AddLast(slideListEntry); } }

// Remove all references to the slide from the custom show. foreach (SlideListEntry slideListEntry in slideListEntries) { customShow.SlideList.RemoveChild(slideListEntry); } } } }

Finally, the code deletes the slide part for the deleted slide.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get the slide part for the specified slide. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart!.GetPartById(slideRelId);

// Remove the slide part. presentationPart.DeletePart(slidePart);

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get the presentation object and pass it to the next CountSlides method. static int CountSlides(string presentationFile) { // Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false)) { // Pass the presentation to the next CountSlide method // and return the slide count. return CountSlides(presentationDocument); } }

// Count the slides in the presentation. static int CountSlides(PresentationDocument presentationDocument) { if (presentationDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("presentationDocument"); }

int slidesCount = 0;

// Get the presentation part of document. PresentationPart? presentationPart =

presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the slide count from the SlideParts. if (presentationPart is not null) { slidesCount = presentationPart.SlideParts.Count(); }

// Return the slide count to the previous method. return slidesCount; }

// Get the presentation object and pass it to the next DeleteSlide method. static void DeleteSlide(string presentationFile, int slideIndex) { // Open the source document as read/write. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) { // Pass the source document and the index of the slide to be deleted to the next DeleteSlide method. DeleteSlide(presentationDocument, slideIndex); } } // Delete the specified slide from the presentation. static void DeleteSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int slideIndex) { if (presentationDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(presentationDocument)); }

// Use the CountSlides sample to get the number of slides in the presentation. int slidesCount = CountSlides(presentationDocument);

if (slideIndex < 0 || slideIndex >= slidesCount) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("slideIndex"); }

// Get the presentation part from the presentation document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the presentation from the presentation part. Presentation? presentation = presentationPart?.Presentation;

// Get the list of slide IDs in the presentation. SlideIdList? slideIdList = presentation?.SlideIdList;

// Get the slide ID of the specified slide SlideId? slideId = slideIdList?.ChildElements[slideIndex] as

SlideId;

// Get the relationship ID of the slide. string? slideRelId = slideId?.RelationshipId;

// If there's no relationship ID, there's no slide to delete. if (slideRelId is null) { return; }

// Remove the slide from the slide list. slideIdList!.RemoveChild(slideId);

// Remove references to the slide from all custom shows. if (presentation!.CustomShowList is not null) { // Iterate through the list of custom shows. foreach (var customShow in presentation.CustomShowList.Elements<CustomShow>()) { if (customShow.SlideList is not null) { // Declare a link list of slide list entries. LinkedList<SlideListEntry> slideListEntries = new LinkedList<SlideListEntry>(); foreach (SlideListEntry slideListEntry in customShow.SlideList.Elements()) { // Find the slide reference to remove from the custom show. if (slideListEntry.Id is not null && slideListEntry.Id == slideRelId) { slideListEntries.AddLast(slideListEntry); } }

// Remove all references to the slide from the custom show. foreach (SlideListEntry slideListEntry in slideListEntries) { customShow.SlideList.RemoveChild(slideListEntry); } } } }

// Get the slide part for the specified slide. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart!.GetPartById(slideRelId);

// Remove the slide part.

presentationPart.DeletePart(slidePart); }

In this code segment, the fileName parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

// Open the presentation file as read-only. using (PresentationDocument document = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, false))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case document .

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

<notesMaster/> NotesMaster Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root element of NotesMasterPart.

## Structure of the Hyperlink Element

In this how-to code example, you are going to work with external hyperlinks. Therefore, it is best to familiarize yourself with the hyperlink element. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the id (Hyperlink Target).

Specifies the ID of the relationship whose target shall be used as the target for thishyperlink.

If this attribute is omitted, then there shall be no external hyperlink target for the current hyperlink - a location in the current document can still be target via the anchor attribute. If this attribute exists, it shall supersede the value in the anchor attribute.

[Example: Consider the following PresentationML fragment for a hyperlink:

<w:hyperlink r:id="rId9"> <w:r> <w:t>https://www.example.com</w:t> </w:r> </w:hyperlink>

The id attribute value of rId9 specifies that relationship in the associated relationship part item with a corresponding Id attribute value must be navigated to when this hyperlink is invoked. For example, if the following XML is present in the associated relationship part item:

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId9" Mode="External" Target="https://www.example.com" /> </Relationships>

The target of this hyperlink would therefore be the target of relationship rId9 - in this case, https://www.example.com . end example]

The possible values for this attribute are defined by the ST_RelationshipId simple type(§22.8.2.1).

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code in this topic consists of one method that takes as a parameter the full path of the presentation file. It iterates through all the slides in the presentation and returns a list of strings that represent the Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) of all the external hyperlinks in the presentation.

C#

C#

// Iterate through all the slide parts in the presentation part. foreach (SlidePart slidePart in document.PresentationPart.SlideParts) { IEnumerable<Drawing.HyperlinkType> links = slidePart.Slide.Descendants<Drawing.HyperlinkType>();

// Iterate through all the links in the slide part. foreach (Drawing.HyperlinkType link in links) { // Iterate through all the external relationships in the slide part. foreach (HyperlinkRelationship relation in slidePart.HyperlinkRelationships) { // If the relationship ID matches the link ID… if (relation.Id.Equals(link.Id)) { // Add the URI of the external relationship to the list of strings. ret.Add(relation.Uri.AbsoluteUri); } } } }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete code sample that you can use to return the list of all external links in a presentation. You can use the following loop in your program to call the GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation method to get the list of URIs in your presentation.

C#

C#

if (args is [{ } fileName]) { foreach (string link in GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation(fileName)) { Console.WriteLine(link); } }

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// Returns all the external hyperlinks in the slides of a presentation. static IEnumerable<String> GetAllExternalHyperlinksInPresentation(string fileName) { // Declare a list of strings. List<string> ret = new List<string>();

// Open the presentation file as read-only. using (PresentationDocument document = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { // If there is no PresentationPart then there are no hyperlinks if (document.PresentationPart is null) { return ret; }

// Iterate through all the slide parts in the presentation part. foreach (SlidePart slidePart in document.PresentationPart.SlideParts) { IEnumerable<Drawing.HyperlinkType> links = slidePart.Slide.Descendants<Drawing.HyperlinkType>();

// Iterate through all the links in the slide part. foreach (Drawing.HyperlinkType link in links) { // Iterate through all the external relationships in the slide part. foreach (HyperlinkRelationship relation in slidePart.HyperlinkRelationships) { // If the relationship ID matches the link ID… if (relation.Id.Equals(link.Id)) { // Add the URI of the external relationship to the list of strings. ret.Add(relation.Uri.AbsoluteUri); } } } } }

// Return the list of strings.

return ret; }

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to get all the text in a slide in a presentation programmatically.

## Getting a PresentationDocument object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read/write access, assign the value true to this parameter; for read-only access assign it the value false as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the file parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

// Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case presentationDocument .

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/>

</p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

PresentationMLOpen XML SDK Description ElementClass Presentation Slide. It is the root element of <sld/> Slide SlidePart. Slide Layout. It is the root element of <sldLayout/> SlideLayout SlideLayoutPart. Slide Master. It is the root element of <sldMaster/> SlideMaster SlideMasterPart. Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root <notesMaster/> NotesMaster element of NotesMasterPart.

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code consists of three overloads of the GetAllTextInSlide method. In the following segment, the first overloaded method opens the source presentation that contains the slide with text to get, and passes the presentation to the second overloaded method, which gets the slide part. This method returns the array of strings that the second method returns to it, each of which represents a paragraph of text in the specified slide.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get all the text in a slide. public static string[] GetAllTextInSlide(string presentationFile, int slideIndex) {

// Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false)) { // Pass the presentation and the slide index // to the next GetAllTextInSlide method, and // then return the array of strings it returns. return GetAllTextInSlide(presentationDocument, slideIndex); } }

The second overloaded method takes the presentation document passed in and gets a slide part to pass to the third overloaded method. It returns to the first overloaded method the array of strings that the third overloaded method returns to it, each of which represents a paragraph of text in the specified slide.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static string[] GetAllTextInSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int slideIndex) { // Verify that the slide index is not out of range. if (slideIndex < 0) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("slideIndex"); }

// Get the presentation part of the presentation document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Verify that the presentation part and presentation exist. if (presentationPart is not null && presentationPart.Presentation is not null) { // Get the Presentation object from the presentation part. Presentation presentation = presentationPart.Presentation;

// Verify that the slide ID list exists. if (presentation.SlideIdList is not null) { // Get the collection of slide IDs from the slide ID list. DocumentFormat.OpenXml.OpenXmlElementList slideIds = presentation.SlideIdList.ChildElements;

// If the slide ID is in range... if (slideIndex < slideIds.Count) {

// Get the relationship ID of the slide. string? slidePartRelationshipId = ((SlideId)slideIds[slideIndex]).RelationshipId;

if (slidePartRelationshipId is null) { return []; }

// Get the specified slide part from the relationship ID. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(slidePartRelationshipId);

// Pass the slide part to the next method, and // then return the array of strings that method // returns to the previous method. return GetAllTextInSlide(slidePart); } } }

// Else, return null. return []; }

The following code segment shows the third overloaded method, which takes takes the slide part passed in, and returns to the second overloaded method a string array of text paragraphs. It starts by verifying that the slide part passed in exists, and then it creates a linked list of strings. It iterates through the paragraphs in the slide passed in, and using a StringBuilder object to concatenate all the lines of text in a paragraph, it assigns each paragraph to a string in the linked list. It then returns to the second overloaded method an array of strings that represents all the text in the specified slide in the presentation.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static string[] GetAllTextInSlide(SlidePart slidePart) { // Verify that the slide part exists. if (slidePart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("slidePart"); }

// Create a new linked list of strings. LinkedList<string> texts = new LinkedList<string>();

// If the slide exists... if (slidePart.Slide is not null) { // Iterate through all the paragraphs in the slide. foreach (DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Paragraph paragraph in

slidePart.Slide.Descendants<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Paragraph>()) { // Create a new string builder. StringBuilder paragraphText = new StringBuilder();

// Iterate through the lines of the paragraph. foreach (DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Text text in

paragraph.Descendants<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Text>()) { // Append each line to the previous lines. paragraphText.Append(text.Text); }

if (paragraphText.Length > 0) { // Add each paragraph to the linked list. texts.AddLast(paragraphText.ToString()); } } }

// Return an array of strings. return texts.ToArray(); }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code that you can use to get all the text in a specific slide in a presentation file. For example, you can use the following foreach loop in your program to get the array of strings returned by the method GetAllTextInSlide , which represents the text in the slide at the index of slideIndex of the presentation file found at the filePath .

C# Visual Basic

C#

foreach (string text in GetAllTextInSlide(filePath, int.Parse(slideIndex))) {

Console.WriteLine(text); }

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get all the text in a slide. public static string[] GetAllTextInSlide(string presentationFile, int slideIndex) { // Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false)) { // Pass the presentation and the slide index // to the next GetAllTextInSlide method, and // then return the array of strings it returns. return GetAllTextInSlide(presentationDocument, slideIndex); } } static string[] GetAllTextInSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int slideIndex) { // Verify that the slide index is not out of range. if (slideIndex < 0) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("slideIndex"); }

// Get the presentation part of the presentation document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Verify that the presentation part and presentation exist. if (presentationPart is not null && presentationPart.Presentation is not null) { // Get the Presentation object from the presentation part. Presentation presentation = presentationPart.Presentation;

if (slideIndex < slideIds.Count) { // Get the relationship ID of the slide. string? slidePartRelationshipId = ((SlideId)slideIds[slideIndex]).RelationshipId;

if (slidePartRelationshipId is null) { return []; }

// Get the specified slide part from the relationship ID. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(slidePartRelationshipId);

// Pass the slide part to the next method, and // then return the array of strings that method // returns to the previous method. return GetAllTextInSlide(slidePart); } } }

// Else, return null. return []; } static string[] GetAllTextInSlide(SlidePart slidePart) { // Verify that the slide part exists. if (slidePart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("slidePart"); }

paragraph.Descendants<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Text>()) { // Append each line to the previous lines.

paragraphText.Append(text.Text); }

if (paragraphText.Length > 0) { // Add each paragraph to the linked list. texts.AddLast(paragraphText.ToString()); } } }

// Return an array of strings. return texts.ToArray(); }

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

PresentationMLOpen XML SDK Description ElementClass Presentation Slide. It is the root element of <sld/> Slide SlidePart. Slide Layout. It is the root element of <sldLayout/> SlideLayout SlideLayoutPart. Slide Master. It is the root element of <sldMaster/> SlideMaster SlideMasterPart. Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root <notesMaster/> NotesMaster element of NotesMasterPart.

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code consists of two overloads of the InsertNewSlide method. The first overloaded method takes three parameters: the full path to the presentation file to which to add a slide, an integer that represents the zero-based slide index position in the presentation where to add the slide, and the string that represents the title of the new slide. It opens the presentation file as read/write, gets a PresentationDocument object, and then passes that object to the second overloaded InsertNewSlide method, which performs the insertion.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Insert a slide into the specified presentation. public static void InsertNewSlide(string presentationFile, int position, string slideTitle) { // Open the source document as read/write. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) { // Pass the source document and the position and title of the

slide to be inserted to the next method. InsertNewSlide(presentationDocument, position, slideTitle); } }

The second overloaded InsertNewSlide method creates a new Slide object, sets its properties, and then inserts it into the slide order in the presentation. The first section of the method creates the slide and sets its properties.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Insert the specified slide into the presentation at the specified position. public static SlidePart InsertNewSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int position, string slideTitle) { PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Verify that the presentation is not empty. if (presentationPart is null) { throw new InvalidOperationException("The presentation document is empty."); }

// Declare and instantiate a new slide. Slide slide = new Slide(new CommonSlideData(new ShapeTree())); uint drawingObjectId = 1;

// Construct the slide content. // Specify the non-visual properties of the new slide. CommonSlideData commonSlideData = slide.CommonSlideData ?? slide.AppendChild(new CommonSlideData()); ShapeTree shapeTree = commonSlideData.ShapeTree ?? commonSlideData.AppendChild(new ShapeTree()); NonVisualGroupShapeProperties nonVisualProperties = shapeTree.AppendChild(new NonVisualGroupShapeProperties()); nonVisualProperties.NonVisualDrawingProperties = new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = 1, Name = "" }; nonVisualProperties.NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties = new NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties(); nonVisualProperties.ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties = new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties();

// Specify the group shape properties of the new slide. shapeTree.AppendChild(new GroupShapeProperties());

The next section of the second overloaded InsertNewSlide method adds a title shape to the slide and sets its properties, including its text.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Declare and instantiate the title shape of the new slide. Shape titleShape = shapeTree.AppendChild(new Shape());

drawingObjectId++;

// Specify the required shape properties for the title shape. titleShape.NonVisualShapeProperties = new NonVisualShapeProperties (new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = drawingObjectId, Name = "Title" }, new NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new Drawing.ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new PlaceholderShape() { Type = PlaceholderValues.Title })); titleShape.ShapeProperties = new ShapeProperties();

// Specify the text of the title shape. titleShape.TextBody = new TextBody(new Drawing.BodyProperties(), new Drawing.ListStyle(), new Drawing.Paragraph(new Drawing.Run(new Drawing.Text() { Text = slideTitle })));

The next section of the second overloaded InsertNewSlide method adds a body shape to the slide and sets its properties, including its text.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Declare and instantiate the body shape of the new slide. Shape bodyShape = shapeTree.AppendChild(new Shape()); drawingObjectId++;

// Specify the required shape properties for the body shape. bodyShape.NonVisualShapeProperties = new NonVisualShapeProperties(new NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = drawingObjectId, Name = "Content Placeholder" }, new NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new Drawing.ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new PlaceholderShape() { Index = 1 })); bodyShape.ShapeProperties = new ShapeProperties();

// Specify the text of the body shape. bodyShape.TextBody = new TextBody(new Drawing.BodyProperties(), new Drawing.ListStyle(), new Drawing.Paragraph());

The final section of the second overloaded InsertNewSlide method creates a new slide part, finds the specified index position where to insert the slide, and then inserts it and assigns the new slide to the new slide part.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Create the slide part for the new slide. SlidePart slidePart = presentationPart.AddNewPart<SlidePart>();

// Assign the new slide to the new slide part slidePart.Slide = slide;

// Modify the slide ID list in the presentation part. // The slide ID list should not be null. SlideIdList? slideIdList = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList;

// Find the highest slide ID in the current list. uint maxSlideId = 1; SlideId? prevSlideId = null;

OpenXmlElementList slideIds = slideIdList?.ChildElements ?? default;

foreach (SlideId slideId in slideIds) { if (slideId.Id is not null && slideId.Id > maxSlideId) { maxSlideId = slideId.Id; }

position--; if (position == 0) { prevSlideId = slideId; }

}

maxSlideId++;

// Get the ID of the previous slide. SlidePart lastSlidePart;

if (prevSlideId is not null && prevSlideId.RelationshipId is not null) {

lastSlidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(prevSlideId.RelationshipId!); } else { string? firstRelId = ((SlideId)slideIds[0]).RelationshipId; // If the first slide does not contain a relationship ID, throw an exception. if (firstRelId is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(firstRelId)); }

lastSlidePart = (SlidePart)presentationPart.GetPartById(firstRelId); }

// Use the same slide layout as that of the previous slide. if (lastSlidePart.SlideLayoutPart is not null) { slidePart.AddPart(lastSlidePart.SlideLayoutPart); }

// Insert the new slide into the slide list after the previous slide. SlideId newSlideId = slideIdList!.InsertAfter(new SlideId(), prevSlideId); newSlideId.Id = maxSlideId; newSlideId.RelationshipId = presentationPart.GetIdOfPart(slidePart);

## Sample Code

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

InsertNewSlide(presentationDocument, position, slideTitle); } } // Insert the specified slide into the presentation at the specified

position. public static SlidePart InsertNewSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int position, string slideTitle) { PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Verify that the presentation is not empty. if (presentationPart is null) { throw new InvalidOperationException("The presentation document is empty."); }

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to move a slide to a new position in a presentation programmatically.

## Getting a Presentation Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call the Open method that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. In order to count the number of slides in a presentation, it is best to open the file for read-only access in order to avoid accidental writing to the file. To do that, specify the value false for the Boolean parameter as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the presentationFile parameter is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

{ // Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case presentationDocument .

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/>

</p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

PresentationMLOpen XML SDK Description ElementClass Presentation Slide. It is the root element of <sld/> Slide SlidePart. Slide Layout. It is the root element of <sldLayout/> SlideLayout SlideLayoutPart. Slide Master. It is the root element of <sldMaster/> SlideMaster SlideMasterPart. Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root <notesMaster/> NotesMaster element of NotesMasterPart.

## How the Sample Code Works

In order to move a specific slide in a presentation file to a new position, you need to know first the number of slides in the presentation. Therefore, the code in this topic is divided into two parts. The first is counting the number of slides, and the second is moving a slide to a new position.

## Counting the Number of Slides

The sample code for counting the number of slides consists of two overloads of the method CountSlides . The first overload uses a string parameter and the second overload uses a PresentationDocument parameter. In the first CountSlides method, the sample code opens the presentation document in the using statement. Then it passes

the PresentationDocument object to the second CountSlides method, which returns an integer number that represents the number of slides in the presentation.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Pass the presentation to the next CountSlides method // and return the slide count. return CountSlides(presentationDocument);

In the second CountSlides method, the code verifies that the PresentationDocument object passed in is not null , and if it is not, it gets a PresentationPart object from the PresentationDocument object. By using the SlideParts the code gets the slideCount and returns it.

C# Visual Basic

C#

int slidesCount = 0;

// Get the presentation part of document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the slide count from the SlideParts. if (presentationPart is not null) { slidesCount = presentationPart.SlideParts.Count(); }

// Return the slide count to the previous method. return slidesCount;

## Moving a Slide from one Position to Another

Moving a slide to a new position requires opening the file for read/write access by specifying the value true to the Boolean parameter as shown in the following using statement. The code for moving a slide consists of two overloads of the MoveSlide method. The first overloaded MoveSlide method takes three parameters: a string that

represents the presentation file name and path and two integers that represent the current index position of the slide and the index position to which to move the slide respectively. It opens the presentation file, gets a PresentationDocument object, and then passes that object and the two integers, from and to , to the second overloaded MoveSlide method, which performs the actual move.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Move a slide to a different position in the slide order in the presentation. public static void MoveSlide(string presentationFile, int from, int to) { using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) { MoveSlide(presentationDocument, from, to); } }

In the second overloaded MoveSlide method, the CountSlides method is called to get the number of slides in the presentation. The code then checks if the zero-based indexes, from and to , are within the range and different from one another.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Move a slide to a different position in the slide order in the presentation. static void MoveSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int from, int to) { if (presentationDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("presentationDocument"); }

// Call the CountSlides method to get the number of slides in the presentation. int slidesCount = CountSlides(presentationDocument);

// Verify that both from and to positions are within range and different from one another. if (from < 0 || from >= slidesCount) {

throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("from"); }

if (to < 0 || from >= slidesCount || to == from) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("to"); }

A PresentationPart object is declared and set equal to the presentation part of the PresentationDocument object passed in. The PresentationPart object is used to create a Presentation object, and then create a SlideIdList object that represents the list of slides in the presentation from the Presentation object. A slide ID of the source slide (the slide to move) is obtained, and then the position of the target slide (the slide after which in the slide order to move the source slide) is identified.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get the presentation part from the presentation document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// The slide count is not zero, so the presentation must contain slides. Presentation? presentation = presentationPart?.Presentation;

if (presentation is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(presentation)); }

SlideIdList? slideIdList = presentation.SlideIdList;

if (slideIdList is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(slideIdList)); }

// Get the slide ID of the source slide. SlideId? sourceSlide = slideIdList.ChildElements[from] as SlideId;

if (sourceSlide is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(sourceSlide)); }

SlideId? targetSlide = null;

// Identify the position of the target slide after which to move the

source slide. if (to == 0) { targetSlide = null; } else if (from < to) { targetSlide = slideIdList.ChildElements[to] as SlideId; } else { targetSlide = slideIdList.ChildElements[to - 1] as SlideId; }

The Remove method of the SlideID object is used to remove the source slide from its current position, and then the InsertAfter method of the SlideIdList object is used to insert the source slide in the index position after the target slide. Finally, the modified presentation is saved.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Remove the source slide from its current position. sourceSlide.Remove();

// Insert the source slide at its new position after the target slide. slideIdList.InsertAfter(sourceSlide, targetSlide);

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code that you can use to move a slide from one position to another in the same presentation file in both C# and Visual Basic.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Counting the slides in the presentation. public static int CountSlides(string presentationFile) { // Open the presentation as read-only. using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument =

PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, false)) { // Pass the presentation to the next CountSlides method // and return the slide count. return CountSlides(presentationDocument); } }

// Count the slides in the presentation. static int CountSlides(PresentationDocument presentationDocument) { int slidesCount = 0;

// Get the presentation part of document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the slide count from the SlideParts. if (presentationPart is not null) { slidesCount = presentationPart.SlideParts.Count(); }

// Return the slide count to the previous method. return slidesCount; }

// Move a slide to a different position in the slide order in the presentation. public static void MoveSlide(string presentationFile, int from, int to) { using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFile, true)) { MoveSlide(presentationDocument, from, to); } }

// Move a slide to a different position in the slide order in the presentation. static void MoveSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument, int from, int to) { if (presentationDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("presentationDocument"); }

// Call the CountSlides method to get the number of slides in the presentation. int slidesCount = CountSlides(presentationDocument);

// Verify that both from and to positions are within range and different from one another. if (from < 0 || from >= slidesCount)

{ throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("from"); }

if (to < 0 || from >= slidesCount || to == from) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("to"); }

// Get the presentation part from the presentation document. PresentationPart? presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// The slide count is not zero, so the presentation must contain slides. Presentation? presentation = presentationPart?.Presentation;

if (presentation is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(presentation)); }

SlideIdList? slideIdList = presentation.SlideIdList;

if (slideIdList is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(slideIdList)); }

// Get the slide ID of the source slide. SlideId? sourceSlide = slideIdList.ChildElements[from] as SlideId;

if (sourceSlide is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(sourceSlide)); }

SlideId? targetSlide = null;

// Identify the position of the target slide after which to move the source slide. if (to == 0) { targetSlide = null; } else if (from < to) { targetSlide = slideIdList.ChildElements[to] as SlideId; } else { targetSlide = slideIdList.ChildElements[to - 1] as SlideId; } // Remove the source slide from its current position. sourceSlide.Remove();

// Insert the source slide at its new position after the target slide. slideIdList.InsertAfter(sourceSlide, targetSlide); }

## How the Sample Code Works

The code in this topic consists of two methods, MoveParagraphToPresentation and GetFirstSlide . The first method takes two string parameters: one that represents the source file, which contains the paragraph to move, and one that represents the target file, to which the paragraph is moved. The method opens both presentation files and then calls the GetFirstSlide method to get the first slide in each file. It then gets the first TextBody shape in each slide and the first paragraph in the source shape. It performs a deep clone of the source paragraph, copying not only the source Paragraph object itself, but also everything contained in that object, including its text. It then inserts the cloned paragraph in the target file and removes the source paragraph from the source file, replacing it with a placeholder paragraph. Finally, it saves the modified slides in both presentations.

C#

C#

// Moves a paragraph range in a TextBody shape in the source document // to another TextBody shape in the target document. static void MoveParagraphToPresentation(string sourceFile, string targetFile) { // Open the source file as read/write.

using (PresentationDocument sourceDoc = PresentationDocument.Open(sourceFile, true)) // </Snippet1 // Open the target file as read/write. using (PresentationDocument targetDoc = PresentationDocument.Open(targetFile, true)) { // Get the first slide in the source presentation. SlidePart slide1 = GetFirstSlide(sourceDoc);

// Get the first TextBody shape in it. TextBody textBody1 = slide1.Slide.Descendants<TextBody> ().First();

// Get the first paragraph in the TextBody shape. // Note: "Drawing" is the alias of namespace DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing Drawing.Paragraph p1 = textBody1.Elements<Drawing.Paragraph> ().First();

// Get the first slide in the target presentation. SlidePart slide2 = GetFirstSlide(targetDoc);

// Get the first TextBody shape in it. TextBody textBody2 = slide2.Slide.Descendants<TextBody> ().First();

// Clone the source paragraph and insert the cloned. paragraph into the target TextBody shape. // Passing "true" creates a deep clone, which creates a copy of the // Paragraph object and everything directly or indirectly referenced by that object. textBody2.Append(p1.CloneNode(true));

// Remove the source paragraph from the source file. textBody1.RemoveChild(p1);

// Replace the removed paragraph with a placeholder. textBody1.AppendChild(new Drawing.Paragraph()); } }

The GetFirstSlide method takes the PresentationDocument object passed in, gets its presentation part, and then gets the ID of the first slide in its slide list. It then gets the relationship ID of the slide, gets the slide part from the relationship ID, and returns the slide part to the calling method.

C#

C#

// Get the slide part of the first slide in the presentation document. static SlidePart GetFirstSlide(PresentationDocument presentationDocument) { // Get relationship ID of the first slide PresentationPart part = presentationDocument.PresentationPart ?? presentationDocument.AddPresentationPart(); SlideIdList slideIdList = part.Presentation.SlideIdList ?? part.Presentation.AppendChild(new SlideIdList()); SlideId slideId = part.Presentation.SlideIdList?.GetFirstChild<SlideId>() ?? slideIdList.AppendChild<SlideId>(new SlideId()); string? relId = slideId.RelationshipId;

if (relId is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(relId)); }

// Get the slide part by the relationship ID. SlidePart slidePart = (SlidePart)part.GetPartById(relId);

return slidePart; }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

# Open a presentation document for

# read-only access

Article • 11/27/2024

This topic describes how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically open a presentation document for read-only access.

## How to Open a File for Read-Only Access

You may want to open a presentation document to read the slides. You might want to extract information from a slide, copy a slide to a slide library, or list the titles of the slides. In such cases you want to do so in a way that ensures the document remains unchanged. You can do that by opening the document for read-only access. This How- To topic discusses several ways to programmatically open a read-only presentation document.

## Create an Instance of the

## PresentationDocument Class

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document call one of the Open methods. Several Open methods are provided, each with a different signature. The following table contains a subset of the overloads for the Open method that you can use to open the package.

NameDescription Open Create a new instance of the PresentationDocument class from the specified file. Open Create a new instance of the PresentationDocument class from the I/O stream. Create a new instance of the PresentationDocument class from the specified Open package.

The previous table includes two Open methods that accept a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read-only access, specify the value false for this parameter.

For example, you can open the presentation file as read-only and assign it to a PresentationDocument object as shown in the following using statement. In this code,

the presentationFile parameter is a string that represents the path of the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationFilePath, false)) { // Insert other code here. }

You can also use the second overload of the Open method, in the table above, to create an instance of the PresentationDocument class based on an I/O stream. You might use this approach if you have a Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 application that uses stream I/O and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a document. The following code segment opens a document based on a stream.

C#

C#

Stream stream = File.Open(strDoc, FileMode.Open); using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(stream, false)) { // Place other code here. }

Suppose you have an application that employs the Open XML support in the System.IO.Packaging namespace of the .NET Framework Class Library, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a package read-only. The Open XML SDK includes a method overload that accepts a Package as the only parameter. There is no Boolean parameter to indicate whether the document should be opened for editing. The recommended approach is to open the package as read-only prior to creating the instance of the PresentationDocument class. The following code segment performs this operation.

C#

C#

Package presentationPackage = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read); using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(presentationPackage)) { // Other code goes here. }

## Basic Presentation Document Structure

The basic document structure of a PresentationML document consists of a number of parts, among which is the main part that contains the presentation definition. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the overall form of a PresentationML package.

The main part of a PresentationML package starts with a presentation root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation; the slide master list refers to the entire slide masters used in the presentation; the notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages; and the handout master describes how a handout looks.

A handout is a printed set of slides that can be provided to an audience.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

Other features that a PresentationML document can include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all authors in a document are stored in one authors part while each slide has its own part.

ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML code example represents a presentation that contains two slides denoted by the IDs 267 and 256.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:p="…" … > <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:notesMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId4"/> </p:notesMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:handoutMasterId xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId5"/> </p:handoutMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="267" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId2"/> <p:sldId id="256" xmlns:rel="https://…/relationships" rel:id="rId3"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> </p:presentation>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the sld, sldLayout, sldMaster, and notesMaster elements.

PresentationMLOpen XML SDK Description ElementClass Presentation Slide. It is the root element of <sld/> Slide SlidePart. Slide Layout. It is the root element of <sldLayout/> SlideLayout SlideLayoutPart. Slide Master. It is the root element of <sldMaster/> SlideMaster SlideMasterPart. Notes Master (or handoutMaster). It is the root <notesMaster/> NotesMaster element of NotesMasterPart.

## How the Sample Code Works

In the sample code, after you open the presentation document in the using statement for read-only access, instantiate the PresentationPart , and open the slide list. Then you get the relationship ID of the first slide.

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get the relationship ID of the first slide. PresentationPart? part = ppt.PresentationPart; OpenXmlElementList slideIds = part?.Presentation?.SlideIdList?.ChildElements ?? default;

// If there are no slide IDs then there are no slides. if (slideIds.Count == 0) { sldText = ""; return; }

string? relId = (slideIds[index] as SlideId)?.RelationshipId;

if (relId is null) { sldText = ""; return; }

From the relationship ID, relId , you get the slide part, and then the inner text of the slide by building a text string using StringBuilder .

C# Visual Basic

C#

// Get the slide part from the relationship ID. SlidePart slide = (SlidePart)part!.GetPartById(relId);

// Build a StringBuilder object. StringBuilder paragraphText = new StringBuilder();

// Get the inner text of the slide: IEnumerable<A.Text> texts = slide.Slide.Descendants<A.Text>(); foreach (A.Text text in texts) { paragraphText.Append(text.Text);

} sldText = paragraphText.ToString();

The inner text of the slide, which is an out parameter of the GetSlideIdAndText method, is passed back to the main method to be displayed.

Important

This example displays only the text in the presentation file. Non-text parts, such as shapes or graphics, are not displayed.

## Sample Code

The following example opens a presentation file for read-only access and gets the inner text of a slide at a specified index. To call the method GetSlideIdAndText pass in the full path of the presentation document. Also pass in the out parameter sldText , which will be assigned a value in the method itself, and then you can display its value in the main program. For example, the following call to the GetSlideIdAndText method gets the inner text in a presentation file from the index and file path passed to the application as arguments.

Tip

The most expected exception in this program is the ArgumentOutOfRangeException exception. It could be thrown if, for example, you have a file with two slides, and you wanted to display the text in slide number 4. Therefore, it is best to use a try block when you call the GetSlideIdAndText method as shown in the following example.

C# Visual Basic

C#

try { string file = args[0]; bool isInt = int.TryParse(args[1], out int i);

if (isInt) { GetSlideIdAndText(out string sldText, file, i); Console.WriteLine($"The text in slide #{i + 1} is {sldText}"); } } catch(ArgumentOutOfRangeException exp) {

Console.Error.WriteLine(exp.Message); }

The following is the complete code listing in C# and Visual Basic.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static void GetSlideIdAndText(out string sldText, string docName, int index) { using (PresentationDocument ppt = PresentationDocument.Open(docName, false)) { // Get the relationship ID of the first slide. PresentationPart? part = ppt.PresentationPart; OpenXmlElementList slideIds = part?.Presentation?.SlideIdList?.ChildElements ?? default;

// If there are no slide IDs then there are no slides. if (slideIds.Count == 0) { sldText = ""; return; }

string? relId = (slideIds[index] as SlideId)?.RelationshipId;

if (relId is null) { sldText = ""; return; }

// Get the slide part from the relationship ID. SlidePart slide = (SlidePart)part!.GetPartById(relId);

// Build a StringBuilder object. StringBuilder paragraphText = new StringBuilder();

// Get the inner text of the slide: IEnumerable<A.Text> texts = slide.Slide.Descendants<A.Text>(); foreach (A.Text text in texts) { paragraphText.Append(text.Text); } sldText = paragraphText.ToString(); } }

# Retrieve the number of slides in a

# presentation document

Article • 11/27/2024

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve the number of slides in a presentation document, either including hidden slides or not, without loading the document into Microsoft PowerPoint. It contains an example RetrieveNumberOfSlides method to illustrate this task.

## RetrieveNumberOfSlides Method

You can use the RetrieveNumberOfSlides method to get the number of slides in a presentation document, optionally including the hidden slides. The RetrieveNumberOfSlides method accepts two parameters: a string that indicates the path of the file that you want to examine, and an optional Boolean value that indicates whether to include hidden slides in the count.

C#

static int RetrieveNumberOfSlides(string fileName, string includeHidden = "true")

## Calling the RetrieveNumberOfSlides Method

The method returns an integer that indicates the number of slides, counting either all the slides or only visible slides, depending on the second parameter value. To call the method, pass all the parameter values, as shown in the following code.

C#

if (args is [{ } fileName, { } includeHidden]) { RetrieveNumberOfSlides(fileName, includeHidden); } else if (args is [{ } fileName2]) {

RetrieveNumberOfSlides(fileName2); }

## How the Code Works

The code starts by creating an integer variable, slidesCount , to hold the number of slides. The code then opens the specified presentation by using the Open method and indicating that the document should be open for read-only access (the final false parameter value). Given the open presentation, the code uses the PresentationPart property to navigate to the main presentation part, storing the reference in a variable named presentationPart .

C#

using (PresentationDocument doc = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if (doc.PresentationPart is not null) { // Get the presentation part of the document. PresentationPart presentationPart = doc.PresentationPart;

## Retrieving the Count of All Slides

If the presentation part reference is not null (and it will not be, for any valid presentation that loads correctly into PowerPoint), the code next calls the Count method on the value of the SlideParts property of the presentation part. If you requested all slides, including hidden slides, that is all there is to do. There is slightly more work to be done if you want to exclude hidden slides, as shown in the following code.

C#

if (includeHidden.ToUpper() == "TRUE") { slidesCount = presentationPart.SlideParts.Count(); }

else {

## Retrieving the Count of Visible Slides

If you requested that the code should limit the return value to include only visible slides, the code must filter its collection of slides to include only those slides that have a Show property that contains a value, and the value is true . If the Show property is null, that also indicates that the slide is visible. This is the most likely scenario. PowerPoint does not set the value of this property, in general, unless the slide is to be hidden. The only way the Show property would exist and have a value of true would be if you had hidden and then unhidden the slide. The following code uses the Where function with a lambda expression to do the work.

C#

// Each slide can include a Show property, which if hidden // will contain the value "0". The Show property may not // exist, and most likely will not, for non-hidden slides. var slides = presentationPart.SlideParts.Where( (s) => (s.Slide is not null) && ((s.Slide.Show is null) || (s.Slide.Show.HasValue && s.Slide.Show.Value)));

slidesCount = slides.Count();

## Sample Code

The following is the complete RetrieveNumberOfSlides code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

if (args is [{ } fileName, { } includeHidden]) { RetrieveNumberOfSlides(fileName, includeHidden); } else if (args is [{ } fileName2])

{ RetrieveNumberOfSlides(fileName2); }

static int RetrieveNumberOfSlides(string fileName, string includeHidden = "true") { int slidesCount = 0; using (PresentationDocument doc = PresentationDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if (doc.PresentationPart is not null) { // Get the presentation part of the document. PresentationPart presentationPart = doc.PresentationPart;

if (presentationPart is not null) { if (includeHidden.ToUpper() == "TRUE") { slidesCount = presentationPart.SlideParts.Count(); } else { // Each slide can include a Show property, which if hidden // will contain the value "0". The Show property may not // exist, and most likely will not, for non-hidden slides. var slides = presentationPart.SlideParts.Where( (s) => (s.Slide is not null) && ((s.Slide.Show is null) || (s.Slide.Show.HasValue && s.Slide.Show.Value)));

slidesCount = slides.Count(); } } } }

Console.WriteLine($"Slide Count: {slidesCount}");

return slidesCount; }

# Structure of a PresentationML

# document

Article • 11/26/2024

The document structure of a PresentationML document consists of the <presentation/> (Presentation) element that contains <sldMaster/> (Slide Master), <sldLayout/> (Slide Layout), <sld/> (Slide), and <theme/> (Theme) elements that reference the slides in the presentation. (The Theme element is the root element of the DrawingMLTheme part.) These elements are the minimum elements required for a valid presentation document.

In addition, a presentation document might contain <notes/> (Notes Slide), <handoutMaster/> (Handout Master), <sp/> (Shape), <pic/> (Picture), <tbl/> (Table), and other slide-related elements. (Table elements are defined in the DrawingML schema.)

Other features that a PresentationML document can contain include the following: animation, audio, video, and transitions between slides.

A PresentationML document is not stored as one large body in a single part. Instead, the elements that implement certain groupings of functionality are stored in separate parts. For example, all comments in a document are stored in one comment part, while each slide has its own part. A separate XML file is created for each slide.

## Important Presentation Parts

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to PresentationML elements. You can find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to some of the important presentation elements.

### Presentation Part

A PresentationML package's main part starts with a <presentation/> root element. That element contains a presentation, which, in turn, refers to a slide list, a slide master list, a notes master list, and a handout master list. The slide list refers to all of the slides in the presentation. The slide master list refers to the entire set of slide masters used in the presentation. The notes master contains information about the formatting of notes pages. The handout master describes how a handout looks. (A handout is a printed set of slides that can be handed out to an audience for future reference.)

### Presentation Properties Part

The root element of the Presentation Properties part is the <presentationPr/> element.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML Presentation Properties part as follows:

An instance of this part type contains all the presentation's properties.

A package shall contain exactly one Presentation Properties part, and that part shall be the target of an implicit relationship from the Presentation (§13.3.6) part.

Example: The following Presentation part-relationship item contains a relationship to the Presentation Properties part, which is stored in the ZIP item presProps.xml:

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId6" Type="https://…/presProps" Target="presProps.xml"/> </Relationships>

The root element for a part of this content type shall be presentationPr. Example:

XML

<p:presentationPr xmlns:p="…" …> <p:clrMru> … </p:clrMru> … </p:presentationPr>

A Presentation Properties part shall be located within the package containing the relationships part (expressed syntactically, the TargetMode attribute of the Relationship element shall be Internal).

A Presentation Properties part shall not have implicit or explicit relationships to any other part defined by ISO/IEC 29500.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Slide Master Part

The root element of the Slide Master part is the <sldMaster/> element.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML Slide Master part as follows:

An instance of this part type contains the master definition of formatting, text, and objects that appear on each slide in the presentation that is derived from this slide master.

A package shall contain one or more Slide Master parts, each of which shall be the target of an explicit relationship from the Presentation (§13.3.6) part, as well as an implicit relationship from any Slide Layout (§13.3.9) part where that slide layout is defined based on this slide master. Each can optionally be the target of a relationship in a Slide Layout (§13.3.9) part as well.

Example: The following Presentation part-relationship item contains a relationship to the Slide Master part, which is stored in the ZIP item slideMasters/slideMaster1.xml:

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId1" Type="https://…/slideMaster" Target="slideMasters/slideMaster1.xml"/> </Relationships>

The root element for a part of this content type shall be sldMaster. Example:

XML

<p:sldMaster xmlns:p="…"> <p:cSld name=""> … </p:cSld> <p:clrMap … /> </p:sldMaster>

A Slide Master part shall be located within the package containing the relationships part (expressed syntactically, the TargetMode attribute of the Relationship element shall be Internal).

A Slide Master part is permitted to have implicit relationships to the following parts defined by ISO/IEC 29500:

Additional Characteristics (§15.2.1) Bibliography (§15.2.3) Custom XML Data Storage (§15.2.4) Theme (§14.2.7) Thumbnail (§15.2.16)

A Slide Master part is permitted to have explicit relationships to the following parts defined by ISO/IEC 29500:

Audio (§15.2.2) Chart (§14.2.1) Content Part (§15.2.4) Diagrams: Diagram Colors (§14.2.3), Diagram Data (§14.2.4), Diagram Layout Definition (§14.2.5), and Diagram Styles (§14.2.6) Embedded Control Persistence (§15.2.9) Embedded Object (§15.2.10) Embedded Package (§15.2.11) Hyperlink (§15.3) Image (§15.2.14) Slide Layout (§13.3.9) Video (§15.2.15)

A Slide Master part shall not have implicit or explicit relationships to any other part defined by ISO/IEC 29500.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Slide Layout Part

The root element of the Slide Layout part is the <sldLayout/> element.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML Slide Layout part as follows:

An instance of this part type contains the definition for a slide layout template for this presentation. This template defines the default appearance and positioning of drawing

objects on this slide type when it is created.

A package shall contain one or more Slide Layout parts, and each of those parts shall be the target of an explicit relationship in the Slide Master (§13.3.10) part, as well as an implicit relationship from each of the Slide (§13.3.8) parts associated with this slide layout.

Example: The following Slide Master part-relationship item contains relationships to several Slide Layout parts, which are stored in the ZIP items ../slideLayouts/slideLayoutN.xml :

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId1" Type="https://…/slideLayout" Target="../slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml"/> <Relationship Id="rId2" Type="https://…/slideLayout" Target="../slideLayouts/slideLayout2.xml"/> <Relationship Id="rId3" Type="https://…/slideLayout" Target="../slideLayouts/slideLayout3.xml"/> </Relationships>

The root element for a part of this content type shall be sldLayout. Example:

XML

A Slide Layout part is permitted to have implicit relationships to the following parts defined by ISO/IEC 29500:

Additional Characteristics (§15.2.1) Bibliography (§15.2.3) Custom XML Data Storage (§15.2.4) Slide Master (§13.3.10) Theme Override (§14.2.8)

Thumbnail (§15.2.16)

A Slide Layout part is permitted to have explicit relationships to the following parts defined by ISO/IEC 29500:

Audio (§15.2.2) Chart (§14.2.1) Content Part (§15.2.4) Diagrams: Diagram Colors (§14.2.3), Diagram Data (§14.2.4), Diagram Layout Definition (§14.2.5), and Diagram Styles (§14.2.6) Embedded Control Persistence (§15.2.9) Embedded Object (§15.2.10) Embedded Package (§15.2.11) Hyperlink (§15.3) Image (§15.2.14) Video (§15.2.15)

A Slide Layout part shall not have implicit or explicit relationships to any other part defined by ISO/IEC 29500.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Slide Part

The root element of the Slide part is the <sld/> element.

As well as text and graphics, each slide can contain comments and notes, can have a layout, and can be part of one or more custom presentations. A comment is an annotation intended for the person maintaining the presentation slide deck. A note is a reminder or piece of text intended for the presenter or the audience.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML Slide part as follows:

A Slide part contains the contents of a single slide.

A package shall contain one Slide part per slide, and each of those parts shall be the target of an explicit relationship from the Presentation (§13.3.6) part.

Example: Consider a PresentationML document having two slides. The corresponding Presentation part relationship item contains two relationships to Slide parts, which are stored in the ZIP items slides/slide1.xml and slides/slide2.xml :

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId2" Type="https://…/slide" Target="slides/slide1.xml"/> <Relationship Id="rId3" Type="https://…/slide" Target="slides/slide2.xml"/> </Relationships>

The root element for a part of this content type shall be <sld/> .

Example: slides/slide1.xml contains:

XML

<p:sld xmlns:p="…"> <p:cSld name=""> … </p:cSld> <p:clrMapOvr> … </p:clrMapOvr> <p:timing> <p:tnLst> <p:par> <p:cTn id="1" dur="indefinite" restart="never" nodeType="tmRoot"/> </p:par> </p:tnLst> </p:timing> </p:sld>

A Slide part shall be located within the package containing the relationships part (expressed syntactically, the TargetMode attribute of the Relationship element shall be Internal).

A Slide part is permitted to have implicit relationships to the following parts defined by ISO/IEC 29500:

### Theme Part

The root element of the Theme part is the <officeStyleSheet/> element.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML DrawingML Theme part as follows:

An instance of this part type contains information about a document's theme, which is a combination of color scheme, font scheme, and format scheme (the latter also being referred to as effects). For a WordprocessingML document, the choice of theme affects the color and style of headings, among other things. For a SpreadsheetML document, the choice of theme affects the color and style of cell contents and charts, among other things. For a PresentationML document, the choice of theme affects the formatting of slides, handouts, and notes via the associated master, in addition to other things.

A WordprocessingML or SpreadsheetML package shall contain zero or one Theme part, which shall be the target of an implicit relationship in a Main Document (§11.3.10) or Workbook (§12.3.23) part. A PresentationML package shall contain zero or one Theme part per Handout Master (§13.3.3), Notes Master (§13.3.4), Slide Master (§13.3.10) or Presentation (§13.3.6) part via an implicit relationship.

Example: The following WordprocessingML Main Document part-relationship item contains a relationship to the Theme part, which is stored in the ZIP item theme/theme1.xml :

XML

<Relationships xmlns="…"> <Relationship Id="rId4" Type="https://…/theme" Target="theme/theme1.xml"/> </Relationships>

The root element for a part of this content type shall be officeStyleSheet.

Example: theme1.xml contains the following, where the name attributes of the clrScheme, fontScheme, and fmtScheme elements correspond to the document's color scheme, font scheme, and format scheme, respectively:

XML

<a:officeStyleSheet xmlns:a="…"> <a:baseStyles> <a:clrScheme name="…"> … </a:clrScheme> <a:fontScheme name="…"> … </a:fontScheme> <a:fmtScheme name="…"> … </a:fmtScheme> </a:baseStyles> <a:objectDefaults/> </a:officeStyleSheet>

A Theme part shall be located within the package containing the relationships part (expressed syntactically, the TargetMode attribute of the Relationship element shall be Internal).

A Theme part is permitted to contain explicit relationships to the following parts defined by ISO/IEC 29500:

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Comments Author Part

The root element of the Comments Author part is the <cmAuthorLst/> element.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML Comments Author part as follows:

An instance of this part type contains information about each author who has added a comment to the document. That information includes the author's name, initials, a unique author-ID, a last-comment-index-used count, and a display color. (The color can be used when displaying comments to distinguish comments from different authors.)

A package shall contain at most one Comment Authors part. If it exists, that part shall be the target of an implicit relationship from the Presentation (§13.3.6) part.

Example: The following Presentation part relationship item contains a relationship to the Comment Authors part, which is stored in the ZIP item commentAuthors.xml :

## The Structure of a Minimum Presentation File

Now that you are familiar with the parts of a PresentationML document, consider how some of these parts are implemented and connected in an actual presentation file. As shown in the article How to: Create a presentation document by providing a file name, you can use the Open XML API to build up a minimum presentation file, part by part.

A minimum presentation file consists of a presentation part, represented by the file presentation.xml, as well as a presentation properties part (presProps.xml), a slide master part (slideMaster.xml), a slide layout part (slideLayout.xml), and a theme part (theme.xml). One or more slide parts (slide.xml) are optional.

The packaging structure of a presentation document contains several references between the parts, including some circular references. For example, slide layouts reference slide masters, and slide masters reference slide layouts.

## Generated PresentationML XML Code

After you run the Open XML SDK code to generate a presentation, you can explore the contents of the .zip package to view the PresentationML XML code. To view the .zip package, rename the extension on the minimum presentation from .pptx to .zip . Inside the .zip package, there are several parts that make up the minimum presentation.

Figure 1 shows the structure under the ppt folder of the zip package for a minimum presentation that contains a single slide.

Figure 1. Minimum presentation folder structure

The presentation.xml file contains <sld/> (Slide) elements that reference the slides in the presentation. Each slide is associated to the presentation by means of a slide ID and a relationship ID. The slideID is the identifier (ID) used within the package to identify a slide and must be unique within the presentation. The id attribute is the relationship ID that identifies the slide part definition associated with a slide. For more information about the slide part, see Working with presentation slides.

The following XML code is the PresentationML that represents the presentation part of a presentation document that contains a single slide. This code is generated when you run the Open XML SDK code to create a minimum presentation.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <p:presentation xmlns:p="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main"> <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId id="2147483648" r:id="rId1"

The following XML code is the PresentationML that represents the relationship part of the presentation document. This code is generated when you run the Open XML SDK to create a minimum presentation.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <Relationships xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships"> <Relationship Type="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/s lide" Target="/ppt/slides/slide.xml" Id="rId2" /> <Relationship Type="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/s lideMaster" Target="/ppt/slideLayouts/slideMasters/slideMaster.xml" Id="rId1" /> <Relationship

Type="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/t heme" Target="/ppt/slideLayouts/slideMasters/theme/theme.xml" Id="rId5" /> </Relationships>

The following XML code is the PresentationML that represents the slide part of the presentation document. Each slide in a presentation has a slide part associated with it. This code is generated when you run the Open XML SDK to create a minimum presentation.

XML

## Typical Presentation Scenario

A typical presentation does not have a minimum configuration. A typical presentation might contain several slides, each of which references slide layouts and slide masters, and which might contain comments. In addition, a presentation might contain handouts and notes slides, each of which is represented by separate parts. These additional parts are contained within the zip package of the presentation document.

Figure 2 shows most of the elements that you would find in a typical presentation.

# Add Transitions between slides in a

# presentation

Article • 05/31/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK to add transition between all slides in a presentation programmatically.

## Getting a Presentation Object

In the Open XML SDK, the PresentationDocument class represents a presentation document package. To work with a presentation document, first create an instance of the PresentationDocument class, and then work with that instance. To create the class instance from the document, call the Open method, that uses a file path, and a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read/write, specify the value true for this parameter as shown in the following using statement. In this code, the file parameter, is a string that represents the path for the file from which you want to open the document.

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(filePath, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. This ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement, in this case ppt .

## The Structure of the Transition

Transition element <transition> specifies the kind of slide transition that should be used to transition to the current slide from the previous slide. That is, the transition information is stored on the slide that appears after the transition is complete.

The following table lists the attributes of the Transition along with the description of each.

ﾉ Expand table

Attribute Description

advClickSpecifies whether a mouse click advances the slide or not. If this attribute is not (Advance onspecified then a value of true is assumed. Click)

advTm (AdvanceSpecifies the time, in milliseconds, after which the transition should start. This setting after time)can be used in conjunction with the advClick attribute. If this attribute is not specified then it is assumed that no auto-advance occurs.

spd (TransitionSpecifies the transition speed that is to be used when transitioning from the current Speed)slide to the next.

[Example: Consider the following example

XML

<p:transition spd="slow" advClick="1" advTm="3000"> <p:randomBar dir="horz"/> </p:transition>

In the above example, the transition speed <speed> is set to slow (available options: slow, med, fast). Advance on Click <advClick> is set to true, and Advance after time <advTm> is set to 3000 milliseconds. The Random Bar child element <randomBar> describes the randomBar slide transition effect, which uses a set of randomly placed horizontal <dir="horz"> or vertical <dir="vert"> bars on the slide that continue to be added until the new slide is fully shown. end example]

A full list of Transition's child elements can be viewed here: Transition

## The Structure of the Alternate Content

Office Open XML defines a mechanism for the storage of content that is not defined by the ISO/IEC 29500 Office Open XML specification, such as extensions developed by future software applications that leverage the Office Open XML formats. This mechanism allows for the storage of a series of alternative representations of content, from which the consuming application can use the first alternative whose requirements are met.

Consider an application that creates a new transition object intended to specify the duration of the transition. This functionality is not defined in the Office Open XML specification. Using an AlternateContent block as follows allows specifying the duration <p14:dur> in milliseconds.

[Example:

XML

<mc:AlternateContent xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup- compatibility/2006" xmlns:p14="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/2010/main"> <mc:Choice Requires="p14"> <p:transition spd="slow" p14:dur="2000" advClick="1" advTm="3000"> <p:randomBar/> </p:transition> </mc:Choice> <mc:Fallback> <p:transition spd="slow" advClick="1" advTm="3000"> <p:randomBar/> </p:transition> </mc:Fallback> </mc:AlternateContent>

The Choice element in the above example requires the dur attribute to specify the duration of the transition, and the Fallback element allows clients that do not support this namespace to see an appropriate alternative representation. end example]

More details on the P14 class can be found here: P14

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the presentation file for read/write access in the using statement, the code gets the presentation part from the presentation document. Then, it retrieves the relationship IDs of all slides in the presentation and gets the slides part from the relationship ID. The code then checks if there are no existing transitions set on the slides and replaces them with a new RandomBarTransition.

C#

C#

// Define the transition start time and duration in milliseconds string startTransitionAfterMs = "3000", durationMs = "2000";

// Set to true if you want to advance to the next slide on mouse click bool advanceOnClick = true;

// Iterate through each slide ID to get slides parts foreach (SlideId slideId in slidesIds) { // Get the relationship ID of the slide

string? relId = slideId!.RelationshipId!.ToString();

if (relId == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("RelationshipId not found"); }

// Get the slide part using the relationship ID SlidePart? slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationDocument.PresentationPart.GetPartById(relId);

// Remove existing transitions if any if (slidePart.Slide.Transition != null) { slidePart.Slide.Transition.Remove(); }

// Check if there are any AlternateContent elements if (slidePart!.Slide.Descendants<AlternateContent>().ToList().Count > 0) { // Get all AlternateContent elements List<AlternateContent> alternateContents = [.. slidePart.Slide.Descendants<AlternateContent>()]; foreach (AlternateContent alternateContent in alternateContents) { // Remove transitions in AlternateContentChoice within AlternateContent List<OpenXmlElement> childElements = alternateContent.ChildElements.ToList();

foreach (OpenXmlElement element in childElements) { List<Transition> transitions = element.Descendants<Transition>().ToList(); foreach (Transition transition in transitions) { transition.Remove(); } } // Add new transitions to AlternateContentChoice and AlternateContentFallback alternateContent!.GetFirstChild<AlternateContentChoice>(); Transition choiceTransition = new Transition(new RandomBarTransition()) { Duration = durationMs, AdvanceAfterTime = startTransitionAfterMs, AdvanceOnClick = advanceOnClick, Speed = TransitionSpeedValues.Slow }; Transition fallbackTransition = new Transition(new RandomBarTransition()) {AdvanceAfterTime = startTransitionAfterMs, AdvanceOnClick = advanceOnClick, Speed = TransitionSpeedValues.Slow }; alternateContent!.GetFirstChild<AlternateContentChoice> ()!.Append(choiceTransition); alternateContent!.GetFirstChild<AlternateContentFallback> ()!.Append(fallbackTransition);

} }

If there are currently no transitions on the slide, code creates new transition. In both cases as a fallback transition, RandomBarTransition is used but without P14:dur (duration) to allow grater support for clients that aren't supporting this namespace

C#

C#

// Add transition if there is none else { // Check if there is a transition appended to the slide and set it to null if (slidePart.Slide.Transition != null) { slidePart.Slide.Transition = null; } // Create a new AlternateContent element AlternateContent alternateContent = new AlternateContent(); alternateContent.AddNamespaceDeclaration("mc", "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006");

// Create a new AlternateContentChoice element and add the transition AlternateContentChoice alternateContentChoice = new AlternateContentChoice() { Requires = "p14" }; Transition choiceTransition = new Transition(new RandomBarTransition()) { Duration = durationMs, AdvanceAfterTime = startTransitionAfterMs, AdvanceOnClick = advanceOnClick, Speed = TransitionSpeedValues.Slow }; Transition fallbackTransition = new Transition(new RandomBarTransition()) { AdvanceAfterTime = startTransitionAfterMs, AdvanceOnClick = advanceOnClick, Speed = TransitionSpeedValues.Slow }; alternateContentChoice.Append(choiceTransition);

// Create a new AlternateContentFallback element and add the transition AlternateContentFallback alternateContentFallback = new AlternateContentFallback(fallbackTransition); alternateContentFallback.AddNamespaceDeclaration("a14", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/drawing/2010/main"); alternateContentFallback.AddNamespaceDeclaration("p16", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/powerpoint/2015/main"); alternateContentFallback.AddNamespaceDeclaration("adec", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/drawing/2017/decorative"); alternateContentFallback.AddNamespaceDeclaration("a16", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/drawing/2014/main");

// Append the AlternateContentChoice and AlternateContentFallback to the AlternateContent alternateContent.Append(alternateContentChoice); alternateContent.Append(alternateContentFallback);

slidePart.Slide.Append(alternateContent); }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code that you can use to add RandomBarTransition to all slides.

C#

C#

AddTransmitionToSlides(args[0]); static void AddTransmitionToSlides(string filePath) { using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(filePath, true)) {

// Check if the presentation part and slide list are available if (presentationDocument.PresentationPart == null || presentationDocument.PresentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList == null) { throw new NullReferenceException("Presentation part is empty or there are no slides"); }

// Get the presentation part PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart;

// Get the list of slide IDs OpenXmlElementList slidesIds = presentationPart.Presentation.SlideIdList.ChildElements;

// Define the transition start time and duration in milliseconds string startTransitionAfterMs = "3000", durationMs = "2000";

// Set to true if you want to advance to the next slide on mouse click bool advanceOnClick = true;

// Iterate through each slide ID to get slides parts foreach (SlideId slideId in slidesIds) { // Get the relationship ID of the slide string? relId = slideId!.RelationshipId!.ToString();

if (relId == null) {

throw new NullReferenceException("RelationshipId not found"); }

// Get the slide part using the relationship ID SlidePart? slidePart = (SlidePart)presentationDocument.PresentationPart.GetPartById(relId);

# Working with animation

Article • 11/26/2024

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office Animate class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

## Animation in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Animation section of the Open XML PresentationML framework as follows:

The Animation section of the PresentationML framework stores the movement and related information of objects. This schema is loosely based on the syntax and concepts from the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL), a W3C Recommendation for describing multimedia presentations using XML. The schema describes all the animations effects that reside on a slide and also the animation that occurs when going from slide to slide (slide transition). Animations on a slide are inherently time-based and consist of an animation effects on an object or text. Slide transitions however do not follow this concept and always appear before any animation on a slide. All elements described in this schema are contained within the slide XML file. More specifically they are in the <transition/> and the <timing/> element as shown below:

XML

<p:sld> <p:cSld> … </p:cSld> <p:clrMapOvr> … </p:clrMapOvr> <p:transition> … </p:transition> <p:timing> … </p:timing> </p:sld>

Animation consists of several behaviors, the most basic of which is the Animate behavior, represented by the <anim/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <anim/> element used to represent basic animation behavior in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element is a generic animation element that requires little or no semantic understanding of the attribute being animated. It can animate text within a shape or

even the shape itself.[Example: Consider trying to emphasize text within a shape by changing the size of its font by 150%. The <anim/> element should be used as follows:

XML

<p:anim to="1.5" calcmode="lin" valueType="num"> <p:cBhvr override="childStyle"> <p:cTn id="1" dur="2000" fill="hold"> <p:tgtEl> <p:spTgt spid="1"> <p:txEl> <p:charRg st="1" end="4"> </p:txEl> </p:spTgt> </p:tgtEl> <p:attrNameLst> <p:attrName>style.fontSize</p:attrName> </p:attrNameLst> </p:cBhvr> </p:anim>

The following table lists the child elements of the <anim/> element used when working with animation and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

ﾉ Expand table

PresentationML Element Open XML SDK Class

<cBhvr/> CommonBehavior

<tavLst/> TimeAnimateValueList

The following table from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the attributes of the <anim/> element.

ﾉ Expand table

Attributes Description

by This attribute specifies a relative offset value for the animation with respect to its position before the start of the animation.The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema string data type.

calcmode This attribute specifies the interpolation mode for the animation.The possible values for this attribute are defined by the ST_TLAnimateBehaviorCalcMode simple type (§19.7.20).

Attributes Description

from This attribute specifies the starting value of the animation.The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema string data type.

to This attribute specifies the ending value for the animation as a percentage.The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema string data type.

valueType This attribute specifies the type of property value.The possible values for this attribute are defined by the ST_TLAnimateBehaviorValueType simple type (§19.7.21).

## Open XML SDK Animate Class

The OXML SDK Animate class represents the <anim/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the Animate class to manipulate individual <anim/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes that represent child elements of the <anim/> element and that are therefore commonly associated with the Animate class are shown in the following list.

### CommonBehavior Class

The CommonBehavior class corresponds to the <cBhvr/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <cBhvr/> element:

This element describes the common behaviors of animations.

Consider trying to emphasize text within a shape by changing the size of its font. The <anim/> element should be used as follows:

XML

<p:anim to="1.5" calcmode="lin" valueType="num"> <p:cBhvr override="childStyle"> <p:cTn id="6" dur="2000" fill="hold"> <p:tgtEl> <p:spTgt spid="3"> <p:txEl> <p:charRg st="4294967295" end="4294967295"/> </p:txEl> </p:spTgt> </p:tgtEl> <p:attrNameLst> <p:attrName>style.fontSize</p:attrName> </p:attrNameLst>

</p:cBhvr> </p:anim>

### TimeAnimateValueList Class

The TimeAnimateValueList class corresponds to the <tavLst/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <tavLst/> element:

This element specifies a list of time animated value elements.

Example: Consider a shape with a "fly-in" animation. The <tav/> element should be used as follows:

XML

<p:anim calcmode="lin" valueType="num"> <p:cBhvr additive="base"> … </p:cBhvr> <p:tavLst> <p:tav tm="0"> <p:val> <p:strVal val="1+#ppt_h/2"/> </p:val> </p:tav> <p:tav tm="100000"> <p:val> <p:strVal val="#ppt_y"/> </p:val> </p:tav> </p:tavLst> </p:anim>

## Working with the Animate Class

The Animate class, which represents the <anim/> element, is therefore also associated with other classes that represent the child elements of the <anim/> element, including the CommonBehavior class, which describes common animation behaviors, and the TimeAnimateValueList class, which specifies a list of time-animated value elements, as shown in the previous XML code. Other classes associated with the Animate class are the Timing class, which specifies timing information for all the animations on the slide, and the TargetElement class, which specifies the target child elements to which the animation effects are applied.

# Working with comments

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office Comment class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

## Comments in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Comments section of the Open XML PresentationML framework as follows:

A comment is a text note attached to a slide, with the primary purpose of allowing readers of a presentation to provide feedback to the presentation author. Each comment contains an unformatted text string and information about its author, and is attached to a particular location on a slide. Comments can be visible while editing the presentation, but do not appear when a slide show is given. The displaying application decides when to display comments and determines their visual appearance.

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <cm/> element used to represent comments in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a single comment attached to a slide. It contains the text of the comment, its position on the slide, and attributes referring to its author and date.

Example:

XML

<p:cm authorId="0" dt="2006-08-28T17:26:44.129" idx="1"> <p:pos x="10" y="10"/> <p:text\>Add diagram to clarify.</p:text> </p:cm>

The following table lists the child elements of the <cm/> element used when working with comments and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

ﾉ Expand table

PresentationML Element Open XML SDK Class

<extLst/> ExtensionListWithModification

<pos/> Position

<text/> Text

The following table from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the attributes of the <cm/> element.

ﾉ Expand table

Attributes Description

authorId This attribute specifies the author of the comment.It refers to the ID of an author in the comment author list for the document. The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema unsignedInt datatype.

dt This attribute specifies the date and time this comment was last modified. The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema datetime datatype.

idx This attribute specifies an identifier for this comment that is unique within a list of all comments by this author in this document. An author's first comment in a document has index 1. Note: Because the index is unique only for the comment author, a document can contain multiple comments with the same index created by different authors. The possible values for this attribute are defined by the ST_Index simple type (§19.7.3).

## Open XML SDK Comment Class

The OXML SDK Comment class represents the <cm/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the Comment class to manipulate individual <cm/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes that represent child elements of the <cm/> element and that are therefore commonly associated with the Comment class are shown in the following list.

### ExtensionListWithModification Class

The ExtensionListWithModification class corresponds to the <extLst/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <extLst/>

element:

This element specifies the extension list with modification ability within which all future extensions of element type <ext/> are defined. The extension list along with corresponding future extensions is used to extend the storage capabilities of the PresentationML framework. This allows for various new kinds of data to be stored natively within the framework.

７ Note

Using this extLst element allows the generating application to store whether this extension property has been modified. end note

### Position Class

The Position class corresponds to the <pos/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <pos/> element:

This element specifies the positioning information for the placement of a comment on a slide surface. In LTR versions of the generating application, this position information should refer to the upper left point of the comment shape. In RTL versions of the generating application, this position information should refer to the upper right point of the comment shape.

[Note: The anchoring point on the slide surface is unaffected by a right-to-left or left-to- right layout change. That is the anchoring point remains the same for all language versions. end note]

[Note: Because there is no specified size or formatting for comments, this UI widget used to display a comment can be any size and thus the lower right point of the comment shape is determined by how the viewing application chooses to display comments. end note]

[Example: <p:pos x="1426" y="660"/> end example]

### Text class

The Text class corresponds to the <text/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <text/> element:

This element specifies the content of a comment. This is the text with which the author has annotated the slide.

The possible values for this element are defined by the W3C XML Schema string datatype.

## Working with the Comment Class

A comment is a text note attached to a slide, with the primary purpose of enabling readers of a presentation to provide feedback to the presentation author. Each comment contains an unformatted text string and information about its author and is attached to a particular location on a slide. Comments can be visible while editing the presentation, but do not appear when a slide show is given. The displaying application decides when to display comments and determines their visual appearance.

As shown in the Open XML SDK code sample that follows, every instance of the Comment class is associated with an instance of the SlideCommentsPart class, which represents a slide comments part, one of the parts of a PresentationML presentation file package, and a part that is required for each slide in a presentation file that contains comments. Each Comment class instance is also associated with an instance of the CommentAuthor class, which is in turn associated with a similarly named presentation part, represented by the CommentAuthorsPart class. Comment authors for a presentation are specified in a comment author list, represented by the CommentAuthorList class, while comments for each slide are listed in a comments list for that slide, represented by the CommentList class.

The Comment class, which represents the <cm/> element, is therefore also associated with other classes that represent the child elements of the <cm/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code sample, are the Position class, which specifies the position of the comment relative to the slide, and the Text class, which specifies the text content of the comment.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code segment from the article How to: Add a comment to a slide in a presentation adds a new comments part to an existing slide in a presentation (if the slide does not already contain comments) and creates an instance of an Open XML SDK Comment class in the slide comments part. It also adds a comment list to the comments part by creating an instance of the CommentList class, if one does not already exist; assigns an ID to the comment; and then adds a comment to the comment list by creating an instance of the Comment class, assigning the required attribute values. In addition, it creates instances of the Position and Text classes associated with the new Comment class instance. For the complete code sample, see the aforementioned article.

# Working with handout master slides

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office HandoutMaster class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML document.

## Handout Master Slides in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <handoutMaster/> element used to represent a handout master slide in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies an instance of a handout master slide. Within a handout master slide are contained all elements that describe the objects and their corresponding formatting for within a handout slide. Within a handout master slide the cSld element specifies the common slide elements such as shapes and their attached text bodies. There are other properties within a handout master slide but cSld encompasses the majority of the intended purpose for a handoutMaster slide.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists the child elements of the <handoutMaster/> element used when working with handout master slides and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

PresentationML ElementOpen XML SDK Class <ClrMap/> ColorMap <cSld/> CommonSlideData <extLst/> ExtensionListWithModification <hf/> HeaderFooter

## Open XML SDK HandoutMaster Class

The Open XML SDK HandoutMaster class represents the <handoutMaster/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the HandoutMaster class to manipulate individual <handoutMaster/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes commonly associated with the HandoutMaster class are shown in the following sections.

### ColorMap Class

The ColorMap class corresponds to the <ClrMap/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <ClrMap/> element:

This element specifies the mapping layer that transforms one color scheme definition to another. Each attribute represents a color name that can be referenced in this master, and the value is the corresponding color in the theme.

Example: Consider the following mapping of colors that applies to a slide master:

XML

<p:clrMap bg1="dk1" tx1="lt1" bg2="dk2" tx2="lt2" accent1="accent1" accent2="accent2" accent3="accent3" accent4="accent4" accent5="accent5" accent6="accent6" hlink="hlink" folHlink="folHlink"/>

### CommonSlideData Class

The CommonSlideData class corresponds to the <cSld/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <cSld/> element:

This element specifies a container for the type of slide information that is relevant to all of the slide types. All slides share a common set of properties that is independent of the slide type; the description of these properties for any particular slide is stored within the slide's <cSld/> container. Slide data specific to the slide type indicated by the parent element is stored elsewhere.

The actual data in <cSld/> describe only the particular parent slide; it is only the type of information stored that is common across all slides.

### ExtensionListWithModification Class

The ExtensionListWithModification class corresponds to the <extLst/> element. The following information from the

ISO/IEC 29500

specification introduces the <extLst/> element:

This element specifies the extension list with modification ability within which all future extensions of element type <ext/> are defined. The extension list along with corresponding future extensions is used to extend the storage capabilities of the PresentationML framework. This allows for various new kinds of data to be stored natively within the framework.

Note

Using this extLst element allows the generating application to store whether this extension property has been modified.

### HeaderFooter Class

The HeaderFooter class corresponds to the <hf/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <hf/> element:

This element specifies the header and footer information for a slide. Headers and footers consist of placeholders for text that should be consistent across all slides and slide types, such as a date and time, slide numbering, and custom header and footer text.

## Working with the HandoutMaster Class

As shown in the Open XML SDK code sample that follows, every instance of the HandoutMaster class is associated with an instance of the HandoutMasterPart class, which represents a handout master part, one of the parts of a PresentationML presentation file package, and a part that is required for a presentation file that contains handouts.

The HandoutMaster class, which represents the <handoutMaster/> element, is therefore also associated with a series of other classes that represent the child elements of the <handoutMaster/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code sample, are the CommonSlideData class, the ColorMap class, the ShapeTree class, and the Shape class.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following method adds a new handout master part to an existing presentation and creates an instance of an Open XML SDK HandoutMaster class in the new handout master part. The HandoutMaster class constructor creates instances of the

CommonSlideData class and the ColorMap class. The CommonSlideData class constructor creates an instance of the ShapeTree class, whose constructor, in turn, creates additional class instances: an instance of the NonVisualGroupShapeProperties class, an instance of the GroupShapeProperties class, and an instance of the Shape class.

The namespace represented by the letter P in the code is the namespace.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static HandoutMasterPart CreateHandoutMasterPart(PresentationPart presentationPart) { HandoutMasterPart handoutMasterPart1 = presentationPart.AddNewPart<HandoutMasterPart>(); handoutMasterPart1.HandoutMaster = new HandoutMaster( new CommonSlideData( new ShapeTree( new P.NonVisualGroupShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)1U, Name = "" }, new P.NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties(), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties()), new GroupShapeProperties(new TransformGroup()), new P.Shape( new P.NonVisualShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)2U, Name = "Title 1" }, new P.NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new PlaceholderShape())), new P.ShapeProperties(), new P.TextBody( new BodyProperties(), new ListStyle(), new Paragraph(new EndParagraphRunProperties() { Language = "en-US" }))))), new P.ColorMap() { Background1 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Light1, Text1 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Dark1, Background2 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Light2, Text2 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Dark2, Accent1 =

D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent1, Accent2 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent2, Accent3 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent3, Accent4 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent4, Accent5 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent5, Accent6 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent6, Hyperlink = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Hyperlink, FollowedHyperlink = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.FollowedHyperlink });

return handoutMasterPart1; }

# Working with notes slides

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office NotesSlide class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema.

## Notes Slides in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <notes/> element used to represent notes slides in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies the existence of a notes slide along with its corresponding data. Contained within a notes slide are all the common slide elements along with additional properties that are specific to the notes element.

Example: Consider the following PresentationML notes slide:

XML

<p:notes> <p:cSld> … </p:cSld> … </p:notes>

In the above example a notes element specifies the existence of a notes slide with all of its parts. Notice the cSld element, which specifies the common elements that can appear on any slide type and then any elements specify additional non-common properties for this notes slide.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The <notes/> element is the root element of the PresentationML Notes Slide part. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

The following table lists the child elements of the <notes/> element used when working with notes slides and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

## Open XML SDK NotesSlide Class

The OXML SDK NotesSlide class represents the <notes/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the NotesSlide class to manipulate individual <notes/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes that represent child elements of the <notes/> element and that are therefore commonly associated with the NotesSlide class are shown in the following list.

### ColorMapOverride Class

The ColorMapOverride class corresponds to the <clrMapOvr/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <clrMapOvr/> element:

This element provides a mechanism with which to override the color schemes listed within the <ClrMap/> element. If the <masterClrMapping/> child element is present, the color scheme defined by the master is used. If the <overrideClrMapping/> child element is present, it defines a new color scheme specific to the parent notes slide, presentation slide, or slide layout.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### CommonSlideData Class

The CommonSlideData class corresponds to the <cSld/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <cSld/> element:

This element specifies a container for the type of slide information that is relevant to all of the slide types. All slides share a common set of properties that is independent of the slide type; the description of these properties for any particular slide is stored within the slide's <cSld/> container. Slide data specific to the slide type indicated by the parent element is stored elsewhere.

The actual data in <cSld/> describe only the particular parent slide; it is only the type of information stored that is common across all slides.

### ExtensionListWithModification Class

The ExtensionListWithModification class corresponds to the <extLst/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <extLst/> element:

This element specifies the extension list with modification ability within which all future extensions of element type <ext/> are defined. The extension list along with corresponding future extensions is used to extend the storage capabilities of the PresentationML framework. This allows for various new kinds of data to be stored natively within the framework.

[Note: Using this extLst element allows the generating application to store whether this extension property has been modified. end note]

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## Working with the NotesSlide Class

As shown in the Open XML SDK code sample that follows, every instance of the NotesSlide class is associated with an instance of the NotesSlidePart class, which represents a notes slide part, one of the parts of a PresentationML presentation file package, and a part that is required for each notes slide in a presentation file. Each NotesSlide class instance may also be associated with an instance of the NotesMaster class, which in turn is associated with a similarly named presentation part, represented by the NotesMasterPart class.

The NotesSlide class, which represents the <notes/> element, is therefore also associated with a series of other classes that represent the child elements of the <notes/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code sample, are the CommonSlideData class and the ColorMapOverride class. The ShapeTree class and the Shape classes are in turn associated with the CommonSlideData class.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

In the following code snippets P represents the namespace and D represents the namespace.

In the snippet below, a presentation is opened with Presentation.Open and the first SlidePart is retrieved or added if the presentation does not already have a SlidePart .

C#

C#

using (PresentationDocument presentationDocument = PresentationDocument.Open(pptxPath, true) ?? throw new Exception("Presentation Document does not exist")) { // Get the first slide in the presentation or use the InsertNewSlide.InsertNewSlideIntoPresentation helper method to insert a new slide. SlidePart slidePart = presentationDocument.PresentationPart?.SlideParts.FirstOrDefault() ?? InsertNewSlideNS.InsertNewSlide(presentationDocument, 1, "my new slide");

// Add a new NoteSlidePart if one does not already exist

NotesSlidePart notesSlidePart = slidePart.NotesSlidePart ?? slidePart.AddNewPart<NotesSlidePart>();

In this snippet the a NoteSlide is added to the NoteSlidePart if one does not already exist. The NotesSlide class constructor creates instances of the CommonSlideData class. The CommonSlideData class constructor creates an instance of the ShapeTree class, whose constructor in turn creates additional class instances: an instance of the NonVisualGroupShapeProperties class, an instance of the GroupShapeProperties class, and an instance of the Shape class.

C#

C#

// Add a NoteSlide to the NoteSlidePart if one does not already exist. notesSlidePart.NotesSlide ??= new P.NotesSlide( new P.CommonSlideData( new P.ShapeTree( new P.NonVisualGroupShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = 1, Name = "" }, new P.NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties(), new P.ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties()), new P.GroupShapeProperties( new D.Transform2D( new D.Offset() { X = 0, Y = 0 }, new D.Extents() { Cx = 0, Cy = 0 }, new D.ChildOffset() { X = 0, Y = 0 }, new D.ChildExtents() { Cx = 0, Cy = 0 })),

The Shape constructor creates an instance of NonVisualShapeProperties, ShapeProperties, and TextBody classes along with their required child elements. The TextBody contains the Paragraph, that has a Run, which contains the text of the note. The slide part is then added to the notes slide part.

C#

C#

new P.Shape( new P.NonVisualShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = 3, Name = "test Placeholder 3" }, new P.NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(), new P.ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(

new P.PlaceholderShape() { Type = PlaceholderValues.Body, Index = 1 })), new P.ShapeProperties(), new P.TextBody( new D.BodyProperties(), new D.Paragraph( new D.Run( new D.Text("This is a test note!"))))))));

notesSlidePart.AddPart(slidePart);

The notes slide part created with the code above contains the following XML

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <p:notes xmlns:p="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main"> <p:cSld> <p:spTree> <p:nvGrpSpPr> <p:cNvPr id="1" name=""/> <p:cNvGrpSpPr/> <p:nvPr/> </p:nvGrpSpPr> <p:grpSpPr> <a:xfrm xmlns:a="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main"> <a:off x="0" y="0"/> <a:ext cx="0" cy="0"/> <a:chOff x="0" y="0"/> <a:chExt cx="0" cy="0"/> </a:xfrm> </p:grpSpPr> <p:sp> <p:nvSpPr> <p:cNvPr id="3" name="test Placeholder 3"/> <p:cNvSpPr/> <p:nvPr/> </p:nvSpPr> <p:spPr/> <p:txBody> <a:bodyPr xmlns:a="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main"/> <a:p xmlns:a="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main"> <a:r> <a:t>This is a test note!</a:t> </a:r> </a:p> </p:txBody> </p:sp>

</p:spTree> </p:cSld> </p:notes>

The following snippets add the required NotesMasterPart and ThemePart if they are missing.

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office Presentation class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML document.

## Presentations in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <presentation/> element used to represent a presentation in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies within it fundamental presentation-wide properties.

Example: Consider the following presentation with a single slide master and two slides. In addition to these commonly used elements there can also be the specification of other properties such as slide size, notes size and default text styles.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:a="" xmlns:r="" xmlns:p=""> <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId id="2147483648" r:id="rId1"> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="256" r:id="rId3"/> <p:sldId id="257" r:id="rId4"/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000" type="screen4x3"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> <p:defaultTextStyle> … </p:defaultTextStyle> </p:presentation>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The <presentation/> element typically contains child elements that list slide masters, slides, and custom slide shows contained within the presentation. In addition, it also commonly contains elements that specify other properties of the presentation, such as slide size, notes size, and default text styles.

The <presentation/> element is the root element of the PresentationML Presentation part. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

The following table lists some of the most common child elements of the <presentation/> element used when working with presentations and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

## Open XML SDK Presentation Class

The Open XML SDK Presentation class represents the <presentation/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the Presentation class to manipulate an individual <presentation/> element in a PresentationML document.

Classes commonly associated with the Presentation class are shown in the following sections.

### SlideMasterIdList Class

All slides that share the same master inherit the same layout from that master. The SlideMasterIdList class corresponds to the <sldMasterIdList/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldMasterIdList/> element used to represent a slide master ID list in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a list of identification information for the slide master slides that are available within the corresponding presentation. A slide master is a slide that is specifically designed to be a template for all related child layout slides.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### SlideMasterId Class

The SlideMasterId class corresponds to the <sldMasterId/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldMasterId/> element used to represent a slide master ID in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a slide master that is available within the corresponding presentation. A slide master is a slide that is specifically designed to be a template for all related child layout slides.

Example: Consider the following specification of a slide master within a presentation

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:a="" xmlns:r="" xmlns:p="" embedTrueTypeFonts="1"> … <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId id="2147483648" r:id="rId1"/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> … </p:presentation>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### SlideIdList Class

The SlideIdList class corresponds to the <sldIdLst/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldIdLst/> element used to represent a slide ID list in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a list of identification information for the slides that are available within the corresponding presentation. A slide contains the information that is specific to a single slide such as slide-specific shape and text information.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### SlideId Class

The SlideId class corresponds to the <sldId/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldId/> element used to represent a slide ID in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a presentation slide that is available within the corresponding presentation. A slide contains the information that is specific to a single slide such as slide-specific shape and text information.

Example: Consider the following specification of a slide master within a presentation

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:a="" xmlns:r="" xmlns:p="" embedTrueTypeFonts="1"> … <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="256" r:id="rId3"/> <p:sldId id="257" r:id="rId4"/> <p:sldId id="258" r:id="rId5"/> <p:sldId id="259" r:id="rId6"/> <p:sldId id="260" r:id="rId7"/> </p:sldIdLst> ... </p:presentation>

### NotesMasterIdList Class

The NotesMasterIdList class corresponds to the <notesMasterIdLst/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <notesMasterIdLst/> element used to represent a notes master ID list in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a list of identification information for the notes master slides that are available within the corresponding presentation. A notes master is a slide that is specifically designed for the printing of the slide along with any attached notes.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### HandoutMasterIdList Class

The HandoutMasterIdList class corresponds to the <handoutMasterIdLst/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <handoutMasterIdLst/> element used to represent a handout master ID list in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a list of identification information for the handout master slides that are available within the corresponding presentation. A handout master is a slide that is specifically designed for printing as a handout.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### CustomShowList Class

The CustomShowList class corresponds to the <custShowLst/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <custShowLst/> element used to represent a custom show list in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a list of all custom shows that are available within the corresponding presentation. A custom show is a defined slide sequence that allows for the displaying of the slides with the presentation in any arbitrary order.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### SlideSize Class

The SlideSize class corresponds to the <sldSz/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldSz/> element used to represent presentation slide size in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies the size of the presentation slide surface. Objects within a presentation slide can be specified outside these extents, but this is the size of background surface that is shown when the slide is presented or printed.

Example: Consider the following specifying of the size of a presentation slide.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:a="" xmlns:r="" xmlns:p="" embedTrueTypeFonts="1">

… <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000" type="screen4x3"/> … </p:presentation>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### NotesSize Class

The NotesSize class corresponds to the <notesSz/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <notesSz/> element used to represent notes slide size in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies the size of slide surface used for notes slides and handout slides. Objects within a notes slide can be specified outside these extents, but the notes slide has a background surface of the specified size when presented or printed. This element is intended to specify the region to which content is fitted in any special format of printout the application might choose to generate, such as an outline handout.

Example: Consider the following specifying of the size of a notes slide.

XML

<p:presentation xmlns:a="" xmlns:r="" xmlns:p="" embedTrueTypeFonts="1"> … <p:notesSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000"/> … </p:presentation>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### DefaultTextStyle Class

The DefaultTextStyle class corresponds to the <defaultTextStyle/> element. The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <defaultTextStyle/> element used to represent default text style in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies the default text styles that are to be used within the presentation. The text style defined here can be referenced when inserting a new slide if that slide is not associated with a master slide or if no styling information has been otherwise specified for the text within the presentation slide.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## Working with the Presentation Class

As shown in the Open XML SDK code example that follows, every instance of the Presentation class is associated with an instance of the PresentationPart class, which represents a presentation part, one of the required parts of a PresentationML presentation file package.

The Presentation class, which represents the <presentation/> element, is therefore also associated with a series of other classes that represent the child elements of the <presentation/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code example, are the SlideMasterIdList , SlideIdList , SlideSize , NotesSize , and DefaultTextStyle classes.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code example from the article How to: Create a presentation document by providing a file name uses the Create method of the PresentationDocument class of the Open XML SDK to create an instance of that same class that has the specified name and file path. Then it uses the AddPresentationPart method to add an instance of the PresentationPart class to the document file. Next, it creates an instance of the Presentation class that represents the presentation. It passes a reference to the PresentationPart class instance to the CreatePresentationParts procedure, which creates the other required parts of the presentation file. The CreatePresentation procedure cleans up by closing the PresentationDocument class instance that it opened previously.

The CreatePresentationParts procedure creates instances of the SlideMasterIdList , SlideIdList , SlideSize , NotesSize , and DefaultTextStyle classes and appends them to the presentation.

C#

C#

static void CreatePresentation(string filepath) { // Create a presentation at a specified file path. The presentation

document type is pptx, by default. using (PresentationDocument presentationDoc = PresentationDocument.Create(filepath, PresentationDocumentType.Presentation)) { PresentationPart presentationPart = presentationDoc.AddPresentationPart(); presentationPart.Presentation = new Presentation();

CreatePresentationParts(presentationPart); } }

static void CreatePresentationParts(PresentationPart presentationPart) { SlideMasterIdList slideMasterIdList1 = new SlideMasterIdList(new SlideMasterId() { Id = (UInt32Value)2147483648U, RelationshipId = "rId1" }); SlideIdList slideIdList1 = new SlideIdList(new SlideId() { Id = (UInt32Value)256U, RelationshipId = "rId2" }); SlideSize slideSize1 = new SlideSize() { Cx = 9144000, Cy = 6858000, Type = SlideSizeValues.Screen4x3 }; NotesSize notesSize1 = new NotesSize() { Cx = 6858000, Cy = 9144000 }; DefaultTextStyle defaultTextStyle1 = new DefaultTextStyle();

presentationPart.Presentation.Append(slideMasterIdList1, slideIdList1, slideSize1, notesSize1, defaultTextStyle1);

SlidePart slidePart1; SlideLayoutPart slideLayoutPart1; SlideMasterPart slideMasterPart1; ThemePart themePart1;

slidePart1 = CreateSlidePart(presentationPart); slideLayoutPart1 = CreateSlideLayoutPart(slidePart1); slideMasterPart1 = CreateSlideMasterPart(slideLayoutPart1); themePart1 = CreateTheme(slideMasterPart1);

slideMasterPart1.AddPart(slideLayoutPart1, "rId1"); presentationPart.AddPart(slideMasterPart1, "rId1"); presentationPart.AddPart(themePart1, "rId5"); }

## Resulting PresentationML

When the Open XML SDK code is run, the following XML is written to the PresentationML document referenced in the code.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <p:presentation xmlns:p="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main"> <p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldMasterId id="2147483648" r:id="rId1" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "/> </p:sldMasterIdLst> <p:sldIdLst> <p:sldId id="256" r:id="rId2" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "/> </p:sldIdLst> <p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="6858000" type="screen4x3"/> <p:notesSz cx="6858000" cy="9144000"/> <p:defaultTextStyle/> </p:presentation>

# Working with presentation slides

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office Slide class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML document.

## Presentation Slides in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sld/> element used to represent a presentation slide in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies a slide within a slide list. The slide list is used to specify an ordering of slides.

Example: Consider the following custom show with an ordering of slides.

XML

<p:custShowLst> <p:custShow name="Custom Show 1" id="0"> <p:sldLst> <p:sld r:id="rId4"/> <p:sld r:id="rId3"/> <p:sld r:id="rId2"/> <p:sld r:id="rId5"/> </p:sldLst> </p:custShow> </p:custShowLst>

In the above example the order specified to present the slides is slide 4, then 3, 2, and finally 5.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The <sld/> element is the root element of the PresentationML Slide part. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

The following table lists the child elements of the <sld/> element used when working with presentation slides and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

PresentationML ElementOpen XML SDK Class <clrMapOvr /> ColorMapOverride <cSld /> CommonSlideData <extLst /> ExtensionListWithModification <timing /> Timing <transition /> Transition

## Open XML SDK Slide Class

The Open XML SDK Slide class represents the <sld/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the Slide object to manipulate individual <sld/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes commonly associated with the Slide class are shown in the following sections.

### ColorMapOverride Class

The ColorMapOverride class corresponds to the <clrMapOvr/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <clrMapOvr/> element:

This element provides a mechanism with which to override the color schemes listed within the <ClrMap/> element. If the <masterClrMapping/> child element is present, the color scheme defined by the master is used. If the <overrideClrMapping/> child element is present, it defines a new color scheme specific to the parent notes slide, presentation slide, or slide layout.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### CommonSlideData Class

The CommonSlideData class corresponds to the <cSld/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <cSld/> element:

This element specifies a container for the type of slide information that is relevant to all of the slide types. All slides share a common set of properties that is independent of the slide type; the description of these properties for any particular slide is stored within the slide's <cSld/> container. Slide data specific to the slide type indicated by the parent element is stored elsewhere.

The actual data in <cSld/> describe only the particular parent slide; it is only the type of information stored that is common across all slides.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### ExtensionListWithModification Class

The ExtensionListWithModification class corresponds to the <extLst/> element. The following information from the

ISO/IEC 29500

specification introduces the <extLst/> element:

This element specifies the extension list with modification ability within which all future extensions of element type <ext/> are defined. The extension list along with corresponding future extensions is used to extend the storage capabilities of the PresentationML framework. This allows for various new kinds of data to be stored natively within the framework.

[Note: Using this extLst element allows the generating application to store whether this extension property has been modified. end note]

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Timing Class

The Timing class corresponds to the <timing/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <timing/> element:

This element specifies the timing information for handling all animations and timed events within the corresponding slide. This information is tracked via time nodes within the <timing/> element. More information on the specifics of these time nodes and how they are to be defined can be found within the Animation section of the PresentationML framework.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Transition Class

The Transition class corresponds to the <transition/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <transition/>

element:

This element specifies the kind of slide transition that should be used to transition to the current slide from the previous slide. That is, the transition information is stored on the slide that appears after the transition is complete.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## Working with the Slide Class

As shown in the Open XML SDK code example that follows, every instance of the Slide class is associated with an instance of the SlidePart class, which represents a slide part, one of the required parts of a PresentationML presentation file package. Each instance of the Slide class must also be associated with instances of the SlideLayout and SlideMaster classes, which are in turn associated with similarly named required presentation parts, represented by the SlideLayoutPart and SlideMasterPart classes.

The Slide class, which represents the <sld/> element, is therefore also associated with a series of other classes that represent the child elements of the <sld/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code example, are the CommonSlideData class, the ColorMapOverride class, the ShapeTree class, and the Shape class.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following method from the article How to: Create a presentation document by providing a file name adds a new slide part to an existing presentation and creates an instance of the Open XML SDK Slide class in the new slide part. The Slide class constructor creates instances of the CommonSlideData and ColorMapOverride classes. The CommonSlideData class constructor creates an instance of the ShapeTree class, whose constructor, in turn, creates additional class instances: an instance of the NonVisualGroupShapeProperties class, the GroupShapeProperties class, and the Shape class.

All of these class instances and instances of the classes that represent the child elements of the <sld/> element are required to create the minimum number of XML elements necessary to represent a new slide.

The namespace represented by the letter P in the code is the namespace.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static SlidePart CreateSlidePart(PresentationPart presentationPart) { SlidePart slidePart1 = presentationPart.AddNewPart<SlidePart> ("rId2"); slidePart1.Slide = new Slide( new CommonSlideData( new ShapeTree( new P.NonVisualGroupShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)1U, Name = "" }, new P.NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties(), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties()), new GroupShapeProperties(new TransformGroup()), new P.Shape( new P.NonVisualShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)2U, Name = "Title 1" }, new P.NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new PlaceholderShape())), new P.ShapeProperties(), new P.TextBody( new BodyProperties(), new ListStyle(), new Paragraph(new EndParagraphRunProperties() { Language = "en-US" }))))), new ColorMapOverride(new MasterColorMapping())); return slidePart1; }

To add another shape to the shape tree and, hence, to the slide, instantiate a second Shape object by passing an additional parameter that contains the following code to the ShapeTree constructor.

C# Visual Basic

C#

new P.Shape( new P.NonVisualShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)2U, Name = "Title 1" }, new P.NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }),

new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new PlaceholderShape())), new P.ShapeProperties(), new P.TextBody( new BodyProperties(), new ListStyle(), new Paragraph(new EndParagraphRunProperties() { Language = "en- US" }))))),

## Generated PresentationML

When the Open XML SDK code in the method is run, the following XML code is written to the PresentationML document file referenced in the code.

# Working with slide layouts

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office SlideLayout class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema.

## Slide Layouts in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldLayout/> element used to represent slide layouts in a PresentationML document as follows:

This element specifies an instance of a slide layout. The slide layout contains in essence a template slide design that can be applied to any existing slide. When applied to an existing slide all corresponding content should be mapped to the new slide layout.

The <sldLayout/> element is the root element of the PresentationML Slide Layout part. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

The following table lists the child elements of the <sldLayout/> element used when working with slide layouts and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

PresentationML ElementOpen XML SDK Class <clrMapOvr/> ColorMapOverride <cSld/> CommonSlideData <extLst/> ExtensionListWithModification <hf/> HeaderFooter <timing/> Timing <transition/> Transition

The following table from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the attributes of the <sldLayout/> element.

Attributes Description Specifies a name to be used in place of the name attribute within the cSld element. This is used for layout matching in matchingNameresponse to layout changes and template applications. (Matching Name) The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema string datatype.

Attributes Description Specifies whether the corresponding slide layout is deleted when all the slides that follow that layout are deleted. If this attribute is not specified then a value of false should be assumed by the generating application. This would mean that preserve (Preserve Slide the slide would in fact be deleted if no slides within the Layout) presentation were related to it.

The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype. Specifies whether or not to display animations on placeholders showMasterPhAnimfrom the master slide. (Show Master Placeholder Animations)The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype. Specifies if shapes on the master slide should be shown on slides or not. showMasterSp (Show Master Shapes) The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype. Specifies the slide layout type that is used by this slide.

type (Slide Layout Type) The possible values for this attribute are defined by the ST_SlideLayoutType simple type (§19.7.15). Specifies if the corresponding object has been drawn by the user and should thus not be deleted. This allows for the userDrawn (Is Userflagging of slides that contain user drawn data. Drawn) The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype.

## The Open XML SDK SlideLayout Class

The OXML SDK SlideLayout class represents the <sldLayout/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the SlideLayout class to manipulate individual <sldLayout/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes that represent child elements of the <sldLayout/> element and that are therefore commonly associated with the SlideLayout class are shown in the following list.

### ColorMapOverride Class

The ColorMapOverride class corresponds to the <clrMapOvr/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <clrMapOvr/> element:

This element provides a mechanism with which to override the color schemes listed within the <ClrMap/> element. If the <masterClrMapping/> child element is present, the color scheme defined by the master is used. If the <overrideClrMapping/> child element is present, it defines a new color scheme specific to the parent notes slide, presentation slide, or slide layout.

### CommonSlideData Class

The CommonSlideData class corresponds to the <cSld/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <cSld/> element:

This element specifies a container for the type of slide information that is relevant to all of the slide types. All slides share a common set of properties that is independent of the slide type; the description of these properties for any particular slide is stored within the slide's <cSld/> container. Slide data specific to the slide type indicated by the parent element is stored elsewhere.

The actual data in <cSld/> describe only the particular parent slide; it is only the type of information stored that is common across all slides.

### ExtensionListWithModification Class

The ExtensionListWithModification class corresponds to the <extLst/> element. The following information from the

ISO/IEC 29500

specification introduces the <extLst/> element:

This element specifies the extension list with modification ability within which all future extensions of element type <ext/> are defined. The extension list along with corresponding future extensions is used to extend the storage capabilities of the PresentationML framework. This allows for various new kinds of data to be stored natively within the framework.

Note

Using this extLst element allows the generating application to store whether this extension property has been modified.

### HeaderFooter Class

The HeaderFooter class corresponds to the <hf/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <hf/> element:

This element specifies the header and footer information for a slide. Headers and footers consist of placeholders for text that should be consistent across all slides and slide types, such as a date and time, slide numbering, and custom header and footer text.

### Timing Class

The Timing class corresponds to the <timing/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <timing/> element:

This element specifies the timing information for handling all animations and timed events within the corresponding slide. This information is tracked via time nodes within the <timing/> element. More information on the specifics of these time nodes and how they are to be defined can be found within the Animation section of the PresentationML framework.

### Transition Class

The Transition class corresponds to the <transition/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <transition/> element:

This element specifies the kind of slide transition that should be used to transition to the current slide from the previous slide. That is, the transition information is stored on the slide that appears after the transition is complete.

## Working with the SlideLayout Class

As shown in the Open XML SDK code sample that follows, every instance of the SlideLayout class is associated with an instance of the SlideLayoutPart class, which represents a slide layout part, one of the required parts of a PresentationML presentation file package. Each SlideLayout class instance must also be associated with

instances of the SlideMaster and Slide classes, which are in turn associated with similarly named required presentation parts, represented by the SlideMasterPart and SlidePart classes.

The SlideLayout class, which represents the <sldLayout/> element, is therefore also associated with a series of other classes that represent the child elements of the <sldLayout/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code sample, are the CommonSlideData class, the ColorMapOverride class, the ShapeTree class, and the Shape class.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following method from the article How to: Create a presentation document by providing a file name adds a new slide layout part to an existing presentation and creates an instance of an Open XML SDK SlideLayout class in the new slide layout part. The SlideLayout class constructor creates instances of the CommonSlideData class and the ColorMapOverride class. The CommonSlideData class constructor creates an instance of the ShapeTree class, whose constructor in turn creates additional class instances: an instance of the NonVisualGroupShapeProperties class, an instance of the GroupShapeProperties class, and an instance of the Shape class.

The namespace represented by the letter P in the code is the namespace.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static SlideLayoutPart CreateSlideLayoutPart(SlidePart slidePart1) { SlideLayoutPart slideLayoutPart1 = slidePart1.AddNewPart<SlideLayoutPart>("rId1"); SlideLayout slideLayout = new SlideLayout( new CommonSlideData(new ShapeTree( new P.NonVisualGroupShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)1U, Name = "" }, new P.NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties(), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties()), new GroupShapeProperties(new TransformGroup()), new P.Shape( new P.NonVisualShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)2U, Name = "" }, new P.NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new

PlaceholderShape())), new P.ShapeProperties(), new P.TextBody( new BodyProperties(), new ListStyle(), new Paragraph(new EndParagraphRunProperties()))))), new ColorMapOverride(new MasterColorMapping())); slideLayoutPart1.SlideLayout = slideLayout; return slideLayoutPart1; }

## Generated PresentationML

When the Open XML SDK code is run, the following XML is written to the PresentationML document file referenced in the code.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <p:sldLayout xmlns:p="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main"> <p:cSld> <p:spTree> <p:nvGrpSpPr> <p:cNvPr id="1" name="" /> <p:cNvGrpSpPr /> <p:nvPr /> </p:nvGrpSpPr> <p:grpSpPr> <a:xfrm xmlns:a="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main" /> </p:grpSpPr> <p:sp> <p:nvSpPr> <p:cNvPr id="2" name="" /> <p:cNvSpPr> <a:spLocks noGrp="1"

# Working with slide masters

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK for Office SlideMaster class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format PresentationML schema.

## Slide Masters in PresentationML

The ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the Open XML PresentationML <sldMaster/> element used to represent slide layouts in a PresentationML document as follows.

This element specifies an instance of a slide master slide. Within a slide master slide are contained all elements that describe the objects and their corresponding formatting for within a presentation slide. Within a slide master slide are two main elements. The cSld element specifies the common slide elements such as shapes and their attached text bodies. Then the txStyles element specifies the formatting for the text within each of these shapes. The other properties within a slide master slide specify other properties for within a presentation slide such as color information, headers and footers, as well as timing and transition information for all corresponding presentation slides.

The <sldMaster/> element is the root element of the PresentationML Slide Master part. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a PresentationML document, see Structure of a PresentationML Document.

The following table lists the child elements of the <sldMaster/> element used when working with slide masters and the Open XML SDK classes that correspond to them.

PresentationML ElementOpen XML SDK Class <clrMap/> ColorMap <cSld/> CommonSlideData <extLst/> ExtensionListWithModification <hf/> HeaderFooter <sldLayoutIdLst/> SlideLayoutIdList <timing/> Timing <transition/> Transition <txStyles/> TextStyles

The following table from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification describes the attributes of the <sldMaster/> element.

Attributes Description Specifies whether the corresponding slide layout is deleted when all the slides that follow that layout are deleted. If this attribute is not specified preservethen a value offalseshould be assumed by the generating application. (PreserveThis would mean that the slide would in fact be deleted if no slides within Slide Master)the presentation were related to it. The possible values for this attribute are defined by the W3C XML Schema Boolean data type.

## Open XML SDK SlideMaster Class

The Open XML SDK SlideMaster class represents the <sldMaster/> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for PresentationML documents. Use the SlideMaster class to manipulate individual <sldMaster/> elements in a PresentationML document.

Classes that represent child elements of the <sldMaster/> element and that are therefore commonly associated with the SlideMaster class are shown in the following list.

### ColorMapOverride Class

The ColorMapOverride class corresponds to the <clrMapOvr/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <clrMapOvr/> element:

This element provides a mechanism with which to override the color schemes listed within the <ClrMap/> element. If the <masterClrMapping/> child element is present, the color scheme defined by the master is used. If the <overrideClrMapping/> child element is present, it defines a new color scheme specific to the parent notes slide, presentation slide, or slide layout.

### CommonSlideData Class

The CommonSlideData class corresponds to the <cSld/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <cSld/> element:

This element specifies a container for the type of slide information that is relevant to all of the slide types. All slides share a common set of properties that is independent of the slide type; the description of these properties for any particular slide is stored within the

slide's <cSld/> container. Slide data specific to the slide type indicated by the parent element is stored elsewhere.

The actual data in <cSld/> describe only the particular parent slide; it is only the type of information stored that is common across all slides.

### ExtensionListWithModification Class

The ExtensionListWithModification class corresponds to the <extLst/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <extLst/> element:

This element specifies the extension list with modification ability within which all future extensions of element type <ext/> are defined. The extension list along with corresponding future extensions is used to extend the storage capabilities of the PresentationML framework. This allows for various new kinds of data to be stored natively within the framework.

Note

Using this extLst element allows the generating application to store whether this extension property has been modified.

### HeaderFooter Class

The HeaderFooter class corresponds to the <hf/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <hf/> element:

This element specifies the header and footer information for a slide. Headers and footers consist of placeholders for text that should be consistent across all slides and slide types, such as a date and time, slide numbering, and custom header and footer text.

### SlideLayoutIdList Class

The SlideLayoutIdList class corresponds to the <sldLayoutIdLst/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <sldLayoutIdLst/> element:

This element specifies the existence of the slide layout identification list. This list is contained within the slide master and is used to determine which layouts are being used within the slide master file. Each layout within the list of slide layouts has its own

identification number and relationship identifier that uniquely identifies it within both the presentation document and the particular master slide within which it is used.

### Timing Class

The Timing class corresponds to the <timing/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <timing/> element:

This element specifies the timing information for handling all animations and timed events within the corresponding slide. This information is tracked via time nodes within the <timing/> element. More information on the specifics of these time nodes and how they are to be defined can be found within the Animation section of the PresentationML framework.

### Transition Class

The Transition class corresponds to the <transition/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <transition/> element:

This element specifies the kind of slide transition that should be used to transition to the current slide from the previous slide. That is, the transition information is stored on the slide that appears after the transition is complete.

### TextStyles Class

The TextStyles class corresponds to the <txStyles/> element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the <txStyles/> element:

This element specifies the text styles within a slide master. Within this element is the styling information for title text, the body text and other slide text as well. This element is only for use within the Slide Master and thus sets the text styles for the corresponding presentation slides.

Consider the case where we would like to specify the title text for a master slide.

XML

<p:txStyles> <p:titleStyle> <a:lvl1pPr algn="ctr" rtl="0" latinLnBrk="0"> <a:spcBef>

<a:spcPct val="0"/> </a:spcBef> <a:buNone/> <a:defRPr sz="4400" kern="1200"> <a:solidFill> <a:schemeClr val="tx1"/> </a:solidFill> <a:latin typeface="+mj-lt"/> <a:ea typeface="+mj-ea"/> <a:cs typeface="+mj-cs"/> </a:defRPr> </a:lvl1pPr> </p:titleStyle> </p:txStyles>

In the previous example the title text is set according to the above formatting for all related slides within the presentation.

## Working with the SlideMaster Class

As shown in the Open XML SDK code sample that follows, every instance of the SlideMaster class is associated with an instance of the SlideMasterPart class, which represents a slide master part, one of the required parts of a PresentationML presentation file package. Each SlideMaster class instance must also be associated with instances of the SlideLayout and Slide classes, which are in turn associated with similarly named required presentation parts, represented by the SlideLayoutPart and SlidePart classes.

The SlideMaster class, which represents the <sldMaster/> element, is therefore also associated with a series of other classes that represent the child elements of the <sldMaster/> element. Among these classes, as shown in the following code sample, are the CommonSlideData class, the ColorMap class, the ShapeTree class, and the Shape class.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following method from the article How to: Create a presentation document by providing a file name adds a new slidemaster part to an existing presentation and creates an instance of an Open XML SDK SlideMaster class in the new slide master part. The SlideMaster class constructor creates instances of the CommonSlideData class and the ColorMap , SlideLayoutIdList , and TextStyles classes. The CommonSlideData class constructor creates an instance of the ShapeTree class, whose constructor in turn creates additional class instances: an instance of the NonVisualGroupShapeProperties class, an

instance of the GroupShapeProperties class, and an instance of the Shape class, among others.

The namespace represented by the letter P in the code is the namespace.

C# Visual Basic

C#

static SlideMasterPart CreateSlideMasterPart(SlideLayoutPart slideLayoutPart1) { SlideMasterPart slideMasterPart1 = slideLayoutPart1.AddNewPart<SlideMasterPart>("rId1"); SlideMaster slideMaster = new SlideMaster( new CommonSlideData(new ShapeTree( new P.NonVisualGroupShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)1U, Name = "" }, new P.NonVisualGroupShapeDrawingProperties(), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties()), new GroupShapeProperties(new TransformGroup()), new P.Shape( new P.NonVisualShapeProperties( new P.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)2U, Name = "Title Placeholder 1" }, new P.NonVisualShapeDrawingProperties(new ShapeLocks() { NoGrouping = true }), new ApplicationNonVisualDrawingProperties(new PlaceholderShape() { Type = PlaceholderValues.Title })), new P.ShapeProperties(), new P.TextBody( new BodyProperties(), new ListStyle(), new Paragraph())))), new P.ColorMap() { Background1 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Light1, Text1 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Dark1, Background2 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Light2, Text2 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Dark2, Accent1 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent1, Accent2 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent2, Accent3 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent3, Accent4 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent4, Accent5 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent5, Accent6 = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Accent6, Hyperlink = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.Hyperlink, FollowedHyperlink = D.ColorSchemeIndexValues.FollowedHyperlink }, new SlideLayoutIdList(new SlideLayoutId() { Id = (UInt32Value)2147483649U, RelationshipId = "rId1" }), new TextStyles(new TitleStyle(), new BodyStyle(), new OtherStyle())); slideMasterPart1.SlideMaster = slideMaster;

return slideMasterPart1; }

# Structure of a SpreadsheetML document

Article • 01/14/2025

The document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the <workbook/> element that contains <sheets/> and <sheet/> elements that reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. These elements are the minimum elements required for a valid spreadsheet document. In addition, a spreadsheet document might contain <table/> , <chartsheet/> , <pivotTableDefinition/> , or other spreadsheet related elements.

## Minimum Workbook Scenario

The following text from the Standard ECMA-376 introduces the minimum workbook scenario.

The smallest possible (blank) workbook must contain the following:

A single sheet

A sheet ID

A relationship Id that points to the location of the sheet definition

© Ecma International: December 2006.

### Open XML SDK Code Example

This code example uses the classes in the Open XML SDK to create a minimum, blank workbook.

C#

C#

static void CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(string filepath) { // Create a spreadsheet document by supplying the filepath. // By default, AutoSave = true, Editable = true, and Type = xlsx. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook))

{ // Add a WorkbookPart to the document. WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); workbookPart.Workbook = new Workbook();

// Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart. WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>(); worksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

// Add Sheets to the Workbook. Sheets sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets());

// Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = "mySheet" }; sheets.Append(sheet); } }

## Typical Workbook Scenario

A typical workbook will not be a blank, minimum workbook. A typical workbook might contain numbers, text, charts, tables, and pivot tables. Each of these additional parts is contained within the .zip package of the spreadsheet document.

The following figure shows most of the elements that you would find in a typical spreadsheet.

# Add custom UI to a spreadsheet

# document

Article • 01/09/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically add custom UI, modifying the ribbon, to a Microsoft Excel worksheet. It contains an example AddCustomUI method to illustrate this task.

## Creating Custom UI

Before using the Open XML SDK to create a ribbon customization in an Excel workbook, you must first create the customization content. Describing the XML required to create a ribbon customization is beyond the scope of this topic. In addition, you will find it far easier to use the Ribbon Designer in Visual Studio to create the customization for you. For more information about customizing the ribbon by using the Visual Studio Ribbon Designer, see Ribbon Designer and Walkthrough: Creating a Custom Tab by Using the Ribbon Designer. For the purposes of this demonstration, you will need an XML file that contains a customization, and the following code provides a simple customization (or you can create your own by using the Visual Studio Ribbon Designer, and then right- click to export the customization to an XML file). The samples below are the xml strings used in this example. This XML content describes a ribbon customization that includes a button labeled "Click Me!" in a group named Group1 on the Add-Ins tab in Excel. When you click the button, it attempts to run a macro named SampleMacro in the host workbook.

C#

C#

string xml = @"<customUI xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/01/customui""> <ribbon> <tabs> <tab idMso=""TabAddIns""> <group id=""Group1"" label=""Group1""> <button id=""Button1"" label=""Click Me!"" showImage=""false"" onAction=""SampleMacro""/> </group> </tab> </tabs>

</ribbon> </customUI>"

## Create the Macro

For this demonstration, the ribbon customization includes a button that attempts to run a macro in the host workbook. To complete the demonstration, you must create a macro in a sample workbook for the button's Click action to call.

1. Create a new workbook.

2. Press Alt+F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.

3. On the Insert tab, click Module to create a new module.

4. Add code such as the following to the new module.

VB

Sub SampleMacro(button As IRibbonControl) MsgBox "You Clicked?" End Sub

5. Save the workbook as an Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook named AddCustomUI.xlsm.

## AddCustomUI Method

The AddCustomUI method accepts two parameters:

filename — A string that contains a file name that specifies the workbook to modify.

customUIContent — A string that contains the custom content (that is, the XML markup that describes the customization).

## Interact with the Workbook

The sample method, AddCustomUI , starts by opening the requested workbook in read/write mode, as shown in the following code.

C#

C#

using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, true))

## Work with the Ribbon Extensibility Part

Next, as shown in the following code, the sample method attempts to retrieve a reference to the single ribbon extensibility part. If the part does not yet exist, the code creates it and stores a reference to the new part.

C#

C#

// You can have only a single ribbon extensibility part. // If the part doesn't exist, create it. RibbonExtensibilityPart part = document.RibbonExtensibilityPart ?? document.AddRibbonExtensibilityPart();

## Add the Customization

Given a reference to the ribbon extensibility part, the following code finishes by setting the part's CustomUI property to a new CustomUI object that contains the supplied customization. Once the customization is in place, the code saves the custom UI.

C#

C#

part.CustomUI = new CustomUI(customUIContent);

## Sample Code

The following is the complete AddCustomUI code sample in C# and Visual Basic. The first argument passed to the AddCustomUI should be the absolute path to the AddCustomUI.xlsm file created from the instructions above.

C#

C#

static void AddCustomUI(string fileName, string customUIContent) { using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { // You can have only a single ribbon extensibility part. // If the part doesn't exist, create it. RibbonExtensibilityPart part = document.RibbonExtensibilityPart ?? document.AddRibbonExtensibilityPart();

part.CustomUI = new CustomUI(customUIContent); } }

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1">

<v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetMLOpen XML SDK Class Description Element

<workbook/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Workbook The root element for the main document part.

<sheets/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Sheets The container for the block level structures such as sheet, fileVersion, and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<sheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheet A sheet that points to a sheet definition file.

<worksheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.A sheet definition file Worksheetthat contains the sheet data.

<row/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Row A row in the cell table.

<c/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue The value of a cell.

## How the Sample Code Works

The sample code starts by passing in to the method CalculateSumOfCellRange a parameter that represents the full path to the source SpreadsheetML file, a parameter that represents the name of the worksheet that contains the cells, a parameter that represents the name of the first cell in the contiguous range, a parameter that represent the name of the last cell in the contiguous range, and a parameter that represents the name of the cell where you want the result displayed.

The code then opens the file for editing as a SpreadsheetDocument document package for read/write access, the code gets the specified Worksheet object. It then gets the index of the row for the first and last cell in the contiguous range by calling the GetRowIndex method. It gets the name of the column for the first and last cell in the contiguous range by calling the GetColumnName method.

For each Row object within the contiguous range, the code iterates through each Cell object and determines if the column of the cell is within the contiguous range by calling the CompareColumn method. If the cell is within the contiguous range, the code adds the value of the cell to the sum. Then it gets the SharedStringTablePart object if it exists. If it does not exist, it creates one using the AddNewPart method. It inserts the result into the SharedStringTablePart object by calling the InsertSharedStringItem method.

The code inserts a new cell for the result into the worksheet by calling the InsertCellInWorksheet method and sets the value of the cell. For more information, see how to insert a cell in a spreadsheet.

C#

C#

static void CalculateSumOfCellRange(string docName, string worksheetName, string firstCellName, string lastCellName, string resultCell) { // Open the document for editing. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true)) { IEnumerable<Sheet>? sheets = document.WorkbookPart?.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>().Where(s => s.Name == worksheetName); string? firstId = sheets?.First().Id; if (sheets is null || firstId is null || sheets.Count() == 0) { // The specified worksheet does not exist. return; }

WorksheetPart worksheetPart = (WorksheetPart)document.WorkbookPart!.GetPartById(firstId); Worksheet worksheet = worksheetPart.Worksheet;

// Get the row number and column name for the first and last cells in the range. uint firstRowNum = GetRowIndex(firstCellName); uint lastRowNum = GetRowIndex(lastCellName); string firstColumn = GetColumnName(firstCellName); string lastColumn = GetColumnName(lastCellName);

double sum = 0;

// Iterate through the cells within the range and add their values to the sum. foreach (Row row in worksheet.Descendants<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex.Value >= firstRowNum && r.RowIndex.Value <= lastRowNum)) { foreach (Cell cell in row) { if (cell.CellReference is not null && cell.CellReference.Value is not null) { string columnName = GetColumnName(cell.CellReference.Value); if (CompareColumn(columnName, firstColumn) >= 0 && CompareColumn(columnName, lastColumn) <= 0 && double.TryParse(cell.CellValue?.Text, out double num)) { sum += num; } } } }

// Get the SharedStringTablePart and add the result to it. // If the SharedStringPart does not exist, create a new one. SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart; if (document.WorkbookPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart> ().Count() > 0) { shareStringPart = document.WorkbookPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart>().First(); } else { shareStringPart = document.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<SharedStringTablePart>(); }

// Insert the result into the SharedStringTablePart. int index = InsertSharedStringItem("Result: " + sum, shareStringPart);

Cell result = InsertCellInWorksheet(GetColumnName(resultCell), GetRowIndex(resultCell), worksheetPart);

// Set the value of the cell. result.CellValue = new CellValue(index.ToString()); result.DataType = new EnumValue<CellValues> (CellValues.SharedString); } }

To get the row index the code passes a parameter that represents the name of the cell, and creates a new regular expression to match the row index portion of the cell name. For more information about regular expressions, see Regular Expression Language Elements. It gets the row index by calling the Match method, and then returns the row index.

C#

C#

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the row index. static uint GetRowIndex(string cellName) { // Create a regular expression to match the row index portion the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex(@"\d+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return uint.Parse(match.Value); }

The code then gets the column name by passing a parameter that represents the name of the cell, and creates a new regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. This regular expression matches any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters. It gets the column name by calling the Match method, and then returns the column name.

C#

C#

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the column name. static string GetColumnName(string cellName) { // Create a regular expression to match the column name portion of

the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex("[A-Za-z]+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return match.Value; }

To compare two columns the code passes in two parameters that represent the columns to compare. If the first column is longer than the second column, it returns 1. If the second column is longer than the first column, it returns -1. Otherwise, it compares the values of the columns using the Compare and returns the result.

C#

C#

// Given two columns, compares the columns. static int CompareColumn(string column1, string column2) { if (column1.Length > column2.Length) { return 1; } else if (column1.Length < column2.Length) { return -1; } else { return string.Compare(column1, column2, true); } }

To insert a SharedStringItem , the code passes in a parameter that represents the text to insert into the cell and a parameter that represents the SharedStringTablePart object for the spreadsheet. If the ShareStringTablePart object does not contain a SharedStringTable object then it creates one. If the text already exists in the ShareStringTable object, then it returns the index for the SharedStringItem object that represents the text. If the text does not exist, create a new SharedStringItem object that represents the text. It then returns the index for the SharedStringItem object that represents the text.

C#

C#

// Given text and a SharedStringTablePart, creates a SharedStringItem with the specified text // and inserts it into the SharedStringTablePart. If the item already exists, returns its index. static int InsertSharedStringItem(string text, SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart) { // If the part does not contain a SharedStringTable, create it. if (shareStringPart.SharedStringTable is null) { shareStringPart.SharedStringTable = new SharedStringTable(); }

int i = 0; foreach (SharedStringItem item in shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.Elements<SharedStringItem>()) { if (item.InnerText == text) { // The text already exists in the part. Return its index. return i; }

i++; }

// The text does not exist in the part. Create the SharedStringItem. shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.AppendChild(new SharedStringItem(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Text(text)));

return i; }

The final step is to insert a cell into the worksheet. The code does that by passing in parameters that represent the name of the column and the number of the row of the cell, and a parameter that represents the worksheet that contains the cell. If the specified row does not exist, it creates the row and append it to the worksheet. If the specified column exists, it finds the cell that matches the row in that column and returns the cell. If the specified column does not exist, it creates the column and inserts it into the worksheet. It then determines where to insert the new cell in the column by iterating through the row elements to find the cell that comes directly after the specified row, in sequential order. It saves this row in the refCell variable. It inserts the new cell before the cell referenced by refCell using the InsertBefore method. It then returns the new Cell object.

C#

C#

// Given a column name, a row index, and a WorksheetPart, inserts a cell into the worksheet. // If the cell already exists, returns it. static Cell InsertCellInWorksheet(string columnName, uint rowIndex, WorksheetPart worksheetPart) { Worksheet worksheet = worksheetPart.Worksheet; SheetData sheetData = worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData>() ?? worksheet.AppendChild(new SheetData()); string cellReference = columnName + rowIndex;

// If the worksheet does not contain a row with the specified row index, insert one. Row row; if (sheetData.Elements<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex == rowIndex).Count() != 0) { row = sheetData.Elements<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex == rowIndex).First(); } else { row = new Row() { RowIndex = rowIndex }; sheetData.Append(row); }

// If there is not a cell with the specified column name, insert one. if (row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference is not null && c.CellReference.Value == columnName + rowIndex).Count() > 0) { return row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference is not null && c.CellReference.Value == cellReference).First(); } else { // Cells must be in sequential order according to CellReference. Determine where to insert the new cell. Cell? refCell = null;

foreach (Cell cell in row.Elements<Cell>()) { if (string.Compare(cell.CellReference?.Value, cellReference, true) > 0) { refCell = cell; break; } }

Cell newCell = new Cell() { CellReference = cellReference };

row.InsertBefore(newCell, refCell);

return newCell; } }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

WorksheetPart worksheetPart = (WorksheetPart)document.WorkbookPart!.GetPartById(firstId); Worksheet worksheet = worksheetPart.Worksheet;

// Get the row number and column name for the first and last cells in the range. uint firstRowNum = GetRowIndex(firstCellName); uint lastRowNum = GetRowIndex(lastCellName); string firstColumn = GetColumnName(firstCellName); string lastColumn = GetColumnName(lastCellName);

# Copy a Worksheet Using SAX (Simple API

# for XML)

Article • 05/07/2025

This topic shows how to use the the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically copy a large worksheet using SAX (Simple API for XML). For more information about the basic structure of a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document.

## Why Use the SAX Approach?

The Open XML SDK provides two ways to parse Office Open XML files: the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Simple API for XML (SAX). The DOM approach is designed to make it easy to query and parse Open XML files by using strongly-typed classes. However, the DOM approach requires loading entire Open XML parts into memory, which can lead to slower processing and Out of Memory exceptions when working with very large parts. The SAX approach reads in the XML in an Open XML part one element at a time without reading in the entire part into memory giving noncached, forward-only access to XML data, which makes it a better choice when reading very large parts, such as a WorksheetPart with hundreds of thousands of rows.

## Using the DOM Approach

Using the DOM approach, we can take advantage of the Open XML SDK's strongly typed classes. The first step is to access the package's WorksheetPart and make sure that it is not null.

C#

using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(path, true)) { // Get the first sheet WorksheetPart? worksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart?.WorksheetParts?.FirstOrDefault();

if (worksheetPart is not null)

Once it is determined that the WorksheetPart to be copied is not null, add a new WorksheetPart to copy it to. Then clone the WorksheetPart 's Worksheet and assign the cloned

Worksheet to the new WorksheetPart 's Worksheet property.

C#

// Add a new WorksheetPart WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart!.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

// Make a copy of the original worksheet Worksheet newWorksheet = (Worksheet)worksheetPart.Worksheet.Clone();

// Add the new worksheet to the new worksheet part newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = newWorksheet;

At this point, the new WorksheetPart has been added, but a new Sheet element must be added to the WorkbookPart 's Sheets's child elements for it to display. To do this, first find the new WorksheetPart 's Id and create a new sheet Id by incrementing the Sheets count by one then append a new Sheet child to the Sheets element. With this, the copied Worksheet is added to the file.

C#

// Find the new WorksheetPart's Id and create a new sheet id string id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart); uint newSheetId = (uint)(sheets!.ChildElements.Count + 1);

// Append a new Sheet with the WorksheetPart's Id and sheet id to the Sheets element sheets.AppendChild(new Sheet() { Name = "My New Sheet", SheetId = newSheetId, Id = id });

## Using the SAX Approach

The SAX approach works on parts, so using the SAX approach, the first step is the same. Access the package's WorksheetPart and make sure that it is not null.

C#

using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(path, true)) {

// Get the first sheet WorksheetPart? worksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart?.WorksheetParts?.FirstOrDefault();

if (worksheetPart is not null)

With SAX, we don't have access to the Clone method. So instead, start by adding a new WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart .

C#

WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart!.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

Then create an instance of the OpenXmlPartReader with the original worksheet part and an instance of the OpenXmlPartWriter with the newly created worksheet part.

C#

using (OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlPartReader.Create(worksheetPart)) using (OpenXmlWriter writer = OpenXmlPartWriter.Create(newWorksheetPart))

Then read the elements one by one with the Read method. If the element is a CellValue the inner text needs to be explicitly added using the GetText method to read the text, because the WriteStartElement does not write the inner text of an element. For other elements we only need to use the WriteStartElement method, because we don't need the other element's inner text.

C#

// Write the XML declaration with the version "1.0". writer.WriteStartDocument();

// Read the elements from the original worksheet part while (reader.Read()) { // If the ElementType is CellValue it's necessary to explicitly add the inner text of the element // or the CellValue element will be empty if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue)) {

if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader); writer.WriteString(reader.GetText()); } else if (reader.IsEndElement) { writer.WriteEndElement(); } } // For other elements write the start and end elements else { if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader); } else if (reader.IsEndElement) { writer.WriteEndElement(); } } }

At this point, the worksheet part has been copied to the newly added part, but as with the DOM approach, we still need to add a Sheet to the Workbook 's Sheets element. Because the SAX approach gives noncached, forward-only access to XML data, it is only possible to prepend element children, which in this case would add the new worksheet to the beginning instead of the end, changing the order of the worksheets. So the DOM approach is necessary here, because we want to append not prepend the new Sheet and since the WorkbookPart is not usually a large part, the performance gains would be minimal.

C#

Sheets? sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>();

if (sheets is null) { spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.AddChild(new Sheets()); }

string id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart); uint newSheetId = (uint)(sheets!.ChildElements.Count + 1);

sheets.AppendChild(new Sheet() { Name = "My New Sheet", SheetId = newSheetId, Id = id });

## Sample Code

Below is the sample code for both the DOM and SAX approaches to copying the data from one sheet to a new one and adding it to the Spreadsheet document. While the DOM approach is simpler and in many cases the preferred choice, with very large documents the SAX approach is better given that it is faster and can prevent Out of Memory exceptions. To see the difference, create a spreadsheet document with many (10,000+) rows and check the results of the Stopwatch to check the difference in execution time. Increase the number of rows to 100,000+ to see even more significant performance gains.

### DOM Approach

C#

void CopySheetDOM(string path) { Console.WriteLine("Starting DOM method");

Stopwatch sw = new(); sw.Start(); using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(path, true)) { // Get the first sheet WorksheetPart? worksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart?.WorksheetParts?.FirstOrDefault();

if (worksheetPart is not null) { // Add a new WorksheetPart WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart!.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

// Make a copy of the original worksheet Worksheet newWorksheet = (Worksheet)worksheetPart.Worksheet.Clone();

// Add the new worksheet to the new worksheet part newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = newWorksheet;

Sheets? sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>();

if (sheets is null) { spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.AddChild(new Sheets()); }

// Find the new WorksheetPart's Id and create a new sheet id string id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart); uint newSheetId = (uint)(sheets!.ChildElements.Count + 1);

// Append a new Sheet with the WorksheetPart's Id and sheet id to the Sheets element sheets.AppendChild(new Sheet() { Name = "My New Sheet", SheetId = newSheetId, Id = id }); } }

sw.Stop();

Console.WriteLine($"DOM method took {sw.Elapsed.TotalSeconds} seconds"); }

### SAX Approach

C#

void CopySheetSAX(string path) { Console.WriteLine("Starting SAX method");

Stopwatch sw = new(); sw.Start(); using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(path, true)) { // Get the first sheet WorksheetPart? worksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart?.WorksheetParts?.FirstOrDefault();

if (worksheetPart is not null) { WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart!.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

using (OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlPartReader.Create(worksheetPart)) using (OpenXmlWriter writer = OpenXmlPartWriter.Create(newWorksheetPart)) { // Write the XML declaration with the version "1.0". writer.WriteStartDocument();

// Read the elements from the original worksheet part while (reader.Read())

{ // If the ElementType is CellValue it's necessary to explicitly add the inner text of the element // or the CellValue element will be empty if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue)) { if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader); writer.WriteString(reader.GetText()); } else if (reader.IsEndElement) { writer.WriteEndElement(); } } // For other elements write the start and end elements else { if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader); } else if (reader.IsEndElement) { writer.WriteEndElement(); } } } }

Sheets? sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>();

if (sheets is null) { spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.Workbook.AddChild(new Sheets()); }

string id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart); uint newSheetId = (uint)(sheets!.ChildElements.Count + 1);

sheets.AppendChild(new Sheet() { Name = "My New Sheet", SheetId = newSheetId, Id = id });

sw.Stop();

Console.WriteLine($"SAX method took {sw.Elapsed.TotalSeconds} seconds"); } } }

# Create a spreadsheet document by

# providing a file name

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically create a spreadsheet document.

## Creating a SpreadsheetDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the SpreadsheetDocument class represents an Excel document package. To create an Excel document, create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a workbook part that serves as a container for the document, and at least one worksheet part. The text is represented in the package as XML using SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance, call the Create method. Several Create methods are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the Create method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter, package , takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to create. The second parameter, type, is a member of the SpreadsheetDocumentType enumeration. This parameter represents the document type. For example, there are different members of the SpreadsheetDocumentType enumeration for add-ins, templates, workbooks, and macro-enabled templates and workbooks.

７ Note

Select the appropriate SpreadsheetDocumentType and ensure that the persisted file has the correct, matching file name extension. If the SpreadsheetDocumentType does not match the file name extension, an error occurs when you open the file in Excel.

The following code example calls the Create method.

C#

// Create a spreadsheet document by supplying the filepath. // By default, AutoSave = true, Editable = true, and Type = xlsx.

using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook))

When you have created the Excel document package, you can add parts to it. To add the workbook part you call the AddWorkbookPart method of the SpreadsheetDocument class.

C#

// Add a WorkbookPart to the document. WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); workbookPart.Workbook = new Workbook();

A workbook part must have at least one worksheet. To add a worksheet, create a new Sheet . When you create a new Sheet , associate the Sheet with the Workbook by passing the Id , SheetId and Name parameters. Use the GetIdOfPart method to get the Id of the Sheet . Then add the new sheet to the Sheet collection by calling the Append method of the Sheets class.

To create the basic document structure using the Open XML SDK, instantiate the Workbook class, assign it to the WorkbookPart property of the main document part, and then add instances of the WorksheetPart, Worksheet , and Sheet . The following code example creates a new worksheet, associates the worksheet, and appends the worksheet to the workbook.

C#

// Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart. WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>(); worksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

// Add Sheets to the Workbook. Sheets sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets());

// Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = "mySheet" }; sheets.Append(sheet);

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static void CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(string filepath) { // Create a spreadsheet document by supplying the filepath. // By default, AutoSave = true, Editable = true, and Type = xlsx. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook)) {

// Add a WorkbookPart to the document. WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); workbookPart.Workbook = new Workbook();

// Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart. WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>(); worksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

// Add Sheets to the Workbook. Sheets sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets());

// Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = "mySheet" }; sheets.Append(sheet); } }

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to delete text from a cell in a spreadsheet document programmatically.

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1">

<v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetMLOpen XML SDK Class Description Element

<workbook/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Workbook The root element for the main document part.

<sheets/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Sheets The container for the block level structures such as sheet, fileVersion, and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<sheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheet A sheet that points to a sheet definition file.

<worksheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.A sheet definition file Worksheetthat contains the sheet data.

<sheetData/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.SheetData The cell table, grouped together by rows.

<row/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Row A row in the cell table.

<c/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue The value of a cell.

## How the sample code works

In the following code example, you delete text from a cell in a SpreadsheetDocument document package. Then, you verify if other cells within the spreadsheet document still reference the text removed from the row, and if they do not, you remove the text from the SharedStringTablePart object by using the Remove method. Then you clean up the SharedStringTablePart object by calling the RemoveSharedStringItem method.

C#

C#

// Given a document, a worksheet name, a column name, and a one-based row index, // deletes the text from the cell at the specified column and row on the specified worksheet. static void DeleteTextFromCell(string docName, string sheetName, string colName, uint rowIndex) { // Open the document for editing. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true)) { IEnumerable<Sheet>? sheets = document.WorkbookPart?.Workbook?.GetFirstChild<Sheets> ()?.Elements<Sheet>()?.Where(s => s.Name is not null && s.Name == sheetName); if (sheets is null || sheets.Count() == 0) { // The specified worksheet does not exist. return; } string? relationshipId = sheets.First()?.Id?.Value;

if (relationshipId is null) { // The worksheet does not have a relationship ID. return; }

WorksheetPart worksheetPart = (WorksheetPart)document.WorkbookPart!.GetPartById(relationshipId);

// Get the cell at the specified column and row. Cell? cell = GetSpreadsheetCell(worksheetPart.Worksheet, colName, rowIndex); if (cell is null) { // The specified cell does not exist. return; }

cell.Remove();

} }

In the following code example, you verify that the cell specified by the column name and row index exists. If so, the code returns the cell; otherwise, it returns null .

C#

C#

// Given a worksheet, a column name, and a row index, gets the cell at the specified column and row. static Cell? GetSpreadsheetCell(Worksheet worksheet, string columnName, uint rowIndex) { IEnumerable<Row>? rows = worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData> ()?.Elements<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex == rowIndex); if (rows is null || rows.Count() == 0) { // A cell does not exist at the specified row. return null; }

IEnumerable<Cell> cells = rows.First().Elements<Cell>().Where(c => string.Compare(c.CellReference?.Value, columnName + rowIndex, true) == 0);

if (cells.Count() == 0) { // A cell does not exist at the specified column, in the specified row. return null; }

return cells.FirstOrDefault(); }

In the following code example, you verify if other cells within the spreadsheet document reference the text specified by the shareStringId parameter. If they do not reference the text, you remove it from the SharedStringTablePart object. You do that by passing a parameter that represents the ID of the text to remove and a parameter that represents the SpreadsheetDocument document package. Then you iterate through each Worksheet object and compare the contents of each Cell object to the shared string ID. If other cells within the spreadsheet document still reference the SharedStringItem object, you do not remove the item from the SharedStringTablePart object. If other cells within the

spreadsheet document no longer reference the SharedStringItem object, you remove the item from the SharedStringTablePart object. Then you iterate through each Worksheet object and Cell object and refresh the shared string references.

C#

C#

// Given a shared string ID and a SpreadsheetDocument, verifies that other cells in the document no longer // reference the specified SharedStringItem and removes the item. static void RemoveSharedStringItem(int shareStringId, SpreadsheetDocument document) { bool remove = true;

if (document.WorkbookPart is null) { return; }

foreach (var part in document.WorkbookPart.GetPartsOfType<WorksheetPart>()) { var cells = part.Worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData> ()?.Descendants<Cell>();

if (cells is null) { continue; }

foreach (var cell in cells) { // Verify if other cells in the document reference the item. if (cell.DataType is not null && cell.DataType.Value == CellValues.SharedString && cell.CellValue?.Text == shareStringId.ToString()) { // Other cells in the document still reference the item. Do not remove the item. remove = false; break; } }

if (!remove) { break; } }

// Other cells in the document do not reference the item. Remove the item. if (remove) { SharedStringTablePart? shareStringTablePart = document.WorkbookPart.SharedStringTablePart;

if (shareStringTablePart is null) { return; }

SharedStringItem item = shareStringTablePart.SharedStringTable.Elements<SharedStringItem> ().ElementAt(shareStringId); if (item is not null) { item.Remove();

// Refresh all the shared string references. foreach (var part in document.WorkbookPart.GetPartsOfType<WorksheetPart>()) { var cells = part.Worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData> ()?.Descendants<Cell>();

if (cells is null) { continue; }

foreach (var cell in cells) { if (cell.DataType is not null && cell.DataType.Value == CellValues.SharedString && int.TryParse(cell.CellValue?.Text, out int itemIndex)) { if (itemIndex > shareStringId) { cell.CellValue.Text = (itemIndex - 1).ToString(); } } } } } } }

## Sample code

The following is the complete code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void DeleteTextFromCell(string docName, string sheetName, string colName, uint rowIndex) { // Open the document for editing. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true)) { IEnumerable<Sheet>? sheets = document.WorkbookPart?.Workbook?.GetFirstChild<Sheets> ()?.Elements<Sheet>()?.Where(s => s.Name is not null && s.Name == sheetName); if (sheets is null || sheets.Count() == 0) { // The specified worksheet does not exist. return; } string? relationshipId = sheets.First()?.Id?.Value;

if (relationshipId is null) { // The worksheet does not have a relationship ID. return; }

WorksheetPart worksheetPart = (WorksheetPart)document.WorkbookPart!.GetPartById(relationshipId);

// Get the cell at the specified column and row. Cell? cell = GetSpreadsheetCell(worksheetPart.Worksheet, colName, rowIndex); if (cell is null) { // The specified cell does not exist. return; }

cell.Remove(); } }

// Given a worksheet, a column name, and a row index, gets the cell at the specified column and row. static Cell? GetSpreadsheetCell(Worksheet worksheet, string columnName, uint rowIndex) { IEnumerable<Row>? rows = worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData> ()?.Elements<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex ==

rowIndex); if (rows is null || rows.Count() == 0) { // A cell does not exist at the specified row. return null; }

IEnumerable<Cell> cells = rows.First().Elements<Cell>().Where(c => string.Compare(c.CellReference?.Value, columnName + rowIndex, true) == 0);

if (cells.Count() == 0) { // A cell does not exist at the specified column, in the specified row. return null; }

return cells.FirstOrDefault(); }

// Given a shared string ID and a SpreadsheetDocument, verifies that other cells in the document no longer // reference the specified SharedStringItem and removes the item. static void RemoveSharedStringItem(int shareStringId, SpreadsheetDocument document) { bool remove = true;

if (document.WorkbookPart is null) { return; }

break; } }

if (!remove) { break; } }

// Other cells in the document do not reference the item. Remove the item. if (remove) { SharedStringTablePart? shareStringTablePart = document.WorkbookPart.SharedStringTablePart;

if (shareStringTablePart is null) { return; }

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to retrieve a column heading in a spreadsheet document programmatically.

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1">

<v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetMLOpen XML SDK Class Description Element

<workbook/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Workbook The root element for the main document part.

<sheets/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Sheets The container for the block level structures such as sheet, fileVersion, and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<sheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheet A sheet that points to a sheet definition file.

<worksheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.A sheet definition file Worksheetthat contains the sheet data.

<sheetData/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.SheetData The cell table, grouped together by rows.

<row/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Row A row in the cell table.

<c/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue The value of a cell.

## How the Sample Code Works

The code in this how-to consists of three methods (functions in Visual Basic): GetColumnHeading , GetColumnName , and GetRowIndex . The last two methods are called from within the GetColumnHeading method.

The GetColumnName method takes the cell name as a parameter. It parses the cell name to get the column name by creating a regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. For more information about regular expressions, see Regular Expression Language Elements.

C#

C#

// Create a regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex("[A-Za-z]+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return match.Value;

The GetRowIndex method takes the cell name as a parameter. It parses the cell name to get the row index by creating a regular expression to match the row index portion of the cell name.

C#

C#

// Create a regular expression to match the row index portion the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex(@"\d+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return uint.Parse(match.Value);

The GetColumnHeading method uses three parameters, the full path to the source spreadsheet file, the name of the worksheet that contains the specified column, and the name of a cell in the column for which to get the heading.

The code gets the name of the column of the specified cell by calling the GetColumnName method. The code also gets the cells in the column and orders them by row using the GetRowIndex method.

C#

C#

// Get the column name for the specified cell. string columnName = GetColumnName(cellName);

// Get the cells in the specified column and order them by row. IEnumerable<Cell> cells = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Descendants<Cell> ().Where(c => string.Compare(GetColumnName(c.CellReference?.Value), columnName, true) == 0) .OrderBy(r => GetRowIndex(r.CellReference) ?? 0);

If the specified column exists, it gets the first cell in the column using the First method. The first cell contains the heading. Otherwise the specified column does not exist and the method returns null / Nothing

C#

C#

if (cells.Count() == 0) { // The specified column does not exist. return null; }

// Get the first cell in the column. Cell headCell = cells.First();

If the content of the cell is stored in the SharedStringTablePart object, it gets the shared string items and returns the content of the column heading using the Parse method. If the content of the cell is not in the SharedStringTable object, it returns the content of the cell.

C#

C#

// If the content of the first cell is stored as a shared string, get the text of the first cell // from the SharedStringTablePart and return it. Otherwise, return the string value of the cell. if (headCell.DataType is not null && headCell.DataType.Value ==

CellValues.SharedString && int.TryParse(headCell.CellValue?.Text, out int index)) { SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart = document.WorkbookPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart>().First(); SharedStringItem[] items = shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.Elements<SharedStringItem> ().ToArray();

return items[index].InnerText; } else { return headCell.CellValue?.Text; }

## Sample Code

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static string? GetColumnHeading(string docName, string worksheetName, string cellName) { // Open the document as read-only. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, false)) { IEnumerable<Sheet>? sheets = document.WorkbookPart?.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>().Where(s => s.Name == worksheetName);

if (sheets is null || sheets.Count() == 0) { // The specified worksheet does not exist. return null; }

string? id = sheets.First().Id;

if (id is null) { // The worksheet does not have an ID. return null; }

WorksheetPart worksheetPart =

(WorksheetPart)document.WorkbookPart!.GetPartById(id);

// Get the column name for the specified cell. string columnName = GetColumnName(cellName);

// Get the cells in the specified column and order them by row. IEnumerable<Cell> cells = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Descendants<Cell>().Where(c => string.Compare(GetColumnName(c.CellReference?.Value), columnName, true) == 0) .OrderBy(r => GetRowIndex(r.CellReference) ?? 0);

if (cells.Count() == 0) { // The specified column does not exist. return null; }

// Get the first cell in the column. Cell headCell = cells.First();

// If the content of the first cell is stored as a shared string, get the text of the first cell // from the SharedStringTablePart and return it. Otherwise, return the string value of the cell. if (headCell.DataType is not null && headCell.DataType.Value == CellValues.SharedString && int.TryParse(headCell.CellValue?.Text, out int index)) { SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart = document.WorkbookPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart>().First(); SharedStringItem[] items = shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.Elements<SharedStringItem> ().ToArray();

return items[index].InnerText; } else { return headCell.CellValue?.Text; } } } // Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the column name. static string GetColumnName(string? cellName) { if (cellName is null) { return string.Empty; }

// Create a regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex("[A-Za-z]+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return match.Value; }

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the row index. static uint? GetRowIndex(string? cellName) { if (cellName is null) { return null; }

// Create a regular expression to match the row index portion the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex(@"\d+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return uint.Parse(match.Value); }

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1">

<v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetMLOpen XML SDK Class Description Element

<workbook/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Workbook The root element for the main document part.

<sheets/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Sheets The container for the block level structures such as sheet, fileVersion, and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<sheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheet A sheet that points to a sheet definition file.

<worksheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.A sheet definition file Worksheetthat contains the sheet data.

<sheetData/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.SheetData The cell table, grouped together by rows.

<row/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Row A row in the cell table.

<c/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue The value of a cell.

## How the Sample Code Works

After you have opened the file for read-only access, you instantiate the Sheets class.

C#

C#

Sheets? sheets = mySpreadsheet.WorkbookPart?.Workbook?.Sheets;

You then you iterate through the Sheets collection and display OpenXmlElement and the OpenXmlAttribute in each element.

C#

C#

foreach (OpenXmlElement sheet in sheets) { foreach (OpenXmlAttribute attr in sheet.GetAttributes()) { Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", attr.LocalName, attr.Value); } }

By displaying the attribute information you get the name and ID for each worksheet in the spreadsheet file.

## Sample code

The following is the complete code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void GetSheetInfo(string fileName) { // Open file as read-only. using (SpreadsheetDocument mySpreadsheet = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { Sheets? sheets = mySpreadsheet.WorkbookPart?.Workbook?.Sheets;

if (sheets is not null) { // For each sheet, display the sheet information. foreach (OpenXmlElement sheet in sheets)

{ foreach (OpenXmlAttribute attr in sheet.GetAttributes()) { Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", attr.LocalName, attr.Value); } } } } }

# Insert a chart into a spreadsheet

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to insert a chart into a spreadsheet document programmatically.

## Row element

In this how-to, you are going to deal with the row, cell, and cell value elements. Therefore it is useful to familiarize yourself with these elements. The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces row ( <row/> ) element.

The row element expresses information about an entire row of a worksheet, and contains all cell definitions for a particular row in the worksheet.

This row expresses information about row 2 in the worksheet, and contains 3 cell definitions.

XML

<row r="2" spans="2:12"> <c r="C2" s="1"> <f>PMT(B3/12,B4,-B5)</f> <v>672.68336574300008</v> </c> <c r="D2"> <v>180</v> </c> <c r="E2"> <v>360</v> </c> </row>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML Schema code example defines the contents of the row element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_Row"> <sequence>

<element name="c" type="CT_Cell" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> <element name="extLst" minOccurs="0" type="CT_ExtensionList"/> </sequence> <attribute name="r" type="xsd:unsignedInt" use="optional"/> <attribute name="spans" type="ST_CellSpans" use="optional"/> <attribute name="s" type="xsd:unsignedInt" use="optional" default="0"/> <attribute name="customFormat" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> <attribute name="ht" type="xsd:double" use="optional"/> <attribute name="hidden" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> <attribute name="customHeight" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> <attribute name="outlineLevel" type="xsd:unsignedByte" use="optional" default="0"/> <attribute name="collapsed" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> <attribute name="thickTop" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> <attribute name="thickBot" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> <attribute name="ph" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> </complexType>

## Cell element

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces cell ( <c/> ) element.

This collection represents a cell in the worksheet. Information about the cell's location (reference), value, data type, formatting, and formula is expressed here.

This example shows the information stored for a cell whose address in the grid is C6, whose style index is 6, and whose value metadata index is 15. The cell contains a formula as well as a calculated result of that formula.

XML

<c r="C6" s="1" vm="15"> <f>CUBEVALUE("xlextdat9 Adventure Works",C$5,$A6)</f> <v>2838512.355</v> </c>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML Schema code example defines the contents of this element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_Cell"> <sequence> <element name="f" type="CT_CellFormula" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="v" type="ST_Xstring" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="is" type="CT_Rst" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/> <element name="extLst" minOccurs="0" type="CT_ExtensionList"/> </sequence> <attribute name="r" type="ST_CellRef" use="optional"/> <attribute name="s" type="xsd:unsignedInt" use="optional" default="0"/> <attribute name="t" type="ST_CellType" use="optional" default="n"/> <attribute name="cm" type="xsd:unsignedInt" use="optional" default="0"/> <attribute name="vm" type="xsd:unsignedInt" use="optional" default="0"/> <attribute name="ph" type="xsd:boolean" use="optional" default="false"/> </complexType>

## Cell value element

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces Cell Value ( <c/> ) element.

This element expresses the value contained in a cell. If the cell contains a string, then this value is an index into the shared string table, pointing to the actual string value. Otherwise, the value of the cell is expressed directly in this element. Cells containing formulas express the last calculated result of the formula in this element.

For applications not wanting to implement the shared string table, an "inline string" may be expressed in an <is/> element under <c/> (instead of a <v/> element under <c/> ), in the same way a string would be expressed in the shared string table.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

In the following example cell B4 contains the number 360.

XML

<c r="B4"> <v>360</v>

</c>

## How the sample code works

After opening the spreadsheet file for read/write access, the code verifies if the specified worksheet exists. It then adds a new DrawingsPart object using the AddNewPart method, appends it to the worksheet, and saves the worksheet part. The code then adds a new ChartPart object, appends a new ChartSpace object to the ChartPart object, and then appends a new EditingLanguage object to the ChartSpace object that specifies the language for the chart is English-US.

C#

C#

IEnumerable<Sheet>? sheets = document.WorkbookPart?.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>().Where(s => s.Name == worksheetName);

if (sheets is null || sheets.Count() == 0) { // The specified worksheet does not exist. return; }

string? id = sheets.First().Id;

if (id is null) { // The worksheet does not have an ID. return; }

WorksheetPart worksheetPart = (WorksheetPart)document.WorkbookPart!.GetPartById(id);

// Add a new drawing to the worksheet. DrawingsPart drawingsPart = worksheetPart.AddNewPart<DrawingsPart>(); worksheetPart.Worksheet.Append(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Drawing() { Id = worksheetPart.GetIdOfPart(drawingsPart) });

// Add a new chart and set the chart language to English-US. ChartPart chartPart = drawingsPart.AddNewPart<ChartPart>(); chartPart.ChartSpace = new ChartSpace(); chartPart.ChartSpace.Append(new EditingLanguage() { Val = new StringValue("en-US") }); DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Charts.Chart chart = chartPart.ChartSpace.AppendChild<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Charts.C

hart>( new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Charts.Chart());

The code creates a new clustered column chart by creating a new BarChart object with BarDirectionValues object set to Column and BarGroupingValues object set to Clustered .

The code then iterates through each key in the Dictionary class. For each key, it appends a BarChartSeries object to the BarChart object and sets the SeriesText object of the BarChartSeries object to equal the key. For each key, it appends a NumberLiteral object to the Values collection of the BarChartSeries object and sets the NumberLiteral object to equal the Dictionary class value corresponding to the key.

C#

C#

// Create a new clustered column chart. PlotArea plotArea = chart.AppendChild<PlotArea>(new PlotArea()); Layout layout = plotArea.AppendChild<Layout>(new Layout()); BarChart barChart = plotArea.AppendChild<BarChart>(new BarChart(new BarDirection() { Val = new EnumValue<BarDirectionValues> (BarDirectionValues.Column) }, new BarGrouping() { Val = new EnumValue<BarGroupingValues> (BarGroupingValues.Clustered) }));

uint i = 0;

// Iterate through each key in the Dictionary collection and add the key to the chart Series // and add the corresponding value to the chart Values. foreach (string key in data.Keys) { BarChartSeries barChartSeries = barChart.AppendChild<BarChartSeries>(new BarChartSeries(new Index() { Val = new UInt32Value(i) }, new Order() { Val = new UInt32Value(i) }, new SeriesText(new NumericValue() { Text = key })));

StringLiteral strLit = barChartSeries.AppendChild<CategoryAxisData>(new CategoryAxisData()).AppendChild<StringLiteral>(new StringLiteral()); strLit.Append(new PointCount() { Val = new UInt32Value(1U) }); strLit.AppendChild<StringPoint>(new StringPoint() { Index = new UInt32Value(0U) }).Append(new NumericValue(title));

i++; }

The code adds the CategoryAxis object and ValueAxis object to the chart and sets the value of the following properties: Scaling, AxisPosition, TickLabelPosition, CrossingAxis, Crosses, AutoLabeled, LabelAlignment, and LabelOffset. It also adds the Legend object to the chart and saves the chart part.

C#

C#

barChart.Append(new AxisId() { Val = new UInt32Value(48650112u) }); barChart.Append(new AxisId() { Val = new UInt32Value(48672768u) });

// Add the Category Axis. CategoryAxis catAx = plotArea.AppendChild<CategoryAxis>(new CategoryAxis(new AxisId() { Val = new UInt32Value(48650112u) }, new Scaling(new Orientation() { Val = new EnumValue<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Charts.OrientationValues> (DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Charts.OrientationValues.MinMax) }), new AxisPosition() { Val = new EnumValue<AxisPositionValues> (AxisPositionValues.Bottom) }, new TickLabelPosition() { Val = new EnumValue<TickLabelPositionValues>(TickLabelPositionValues.NextTo) }, new CrossingAxis() { Val = new UInt32Value(48672768U) }, new Crosses() { Val = new EnumValue<CrossesValues> (CrossesValues.AutoZero) }, new AutoLabeled() { Val = new BooleanValue(true) }, new LabelAlignment() { Val = new EnumValue<LabelAlignmentValues>(LabelAlignmentValues.Center) },

new LabelOffset() { Val = new UInt16Value((ushort)100) }));

// Add the Value Axis. ValueAxis valAx = plotArea.AppendChild<ValueAxis>(new ValueAxis(new AxisId() { Val = new UInt32Value(48672768u) }, new Scaling(new Orientation() { Val = new EnumValue<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Charts.OrientationValues>(

// Add the chart Legend. Legend legend = chart.AppendChild<Legend>(new Legend(new LegendPosition() { Val = new EnumValue<LegendPositionValues> (LegendPositionValues.Right) }, new Layout()));

chart.Append(new PlotVisibleOnly() { Val = new BooleanValue(true) });

The code positions the chart on the worksheet by creating a WorksheetDrawing object and appending a TwoCellAnchor object. The TwoCellAnchor object specifies how to move or resize the chart if you move the rows and columns between the FromMarker and ToMarker anchors. The code then creates a GraphicFrame object to contain the chart and names the chart "Chart 1".

C#

C#

// Position the chart on the worksheet using a TwoCellAnchor object.

drawingsPart.WorksheetDrawing = new WorksheetDrawing(); TwoCellAnchor twoCellAnchor = drawingsPart.WorksheetDrawing.AppendChild<TwoCellAnchor>(new TwoCellAnchor()); twoCellAnchor.Append(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Spreadsheet.FromMarker(new ColumnId("9"), new ColumnOffset("581025"), new RowId("17"), new RowOffset("114300"))); twoCellAnchor.Append(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Spreadsheet.ToMarker(new ColumnId("17"), new ColumnOffset("276225"), new RowId("32"), new RowOffset("0")));

// Append a GraphicFrame to the TwoCellAnchor object. DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Spreadsheet.GraphicFrame graphicFrame = twoCellAnchor.AppendChild<DocumentFormat.OpenXml. Drawing.Spreadsheet.GraphicFrame>(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing. Spreadsheet.GraphicFrame()); graphicFrame.Macro = "";

graphicFrame.Append(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Spreadsheet.NonVisualGraphicFrameProperti es( new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Spreadsheet.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = new UInt32Value(2u), Name = "Chart 1" }, new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Spreadsheet.NonVisualGraphicFrameDrawingP roperties()));

graphicFrame.Append(new Transform(new Offset() { X = 0L, Y = 0L }, new Extents() { Cx = 0L, Cy = 0L }));

graphicFrame.Append(new Graphic(new GraphicData(new ChartReference() { Id = drawingsPart.GetIdOfPart(chartPart) }) { Uri = "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/chart" }));

twoCellAnchor.Append(new ClientData());

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to insert a new worksheet into a spreadsheet document programmatically.

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the SpreadsheetDocument class represents an Excel document package. To open and work with an Excel document, you create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the document. After you create the instance from the document, you can then obtain access to the main workbook part that contains the worksheets. The text in the document is represented in the package as XML using SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance from the document that you call one of the Open methods. Several are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the Open(String, Boolean) method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to open. The second parameter is either true or false and represents whether you want the file to be opened for editing. Any changes that you make to the document will not be saved if this parameter is false .

The code that calls the Open method is shown in the following using statement.

C#

C#

// Open the document for editing. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadSheet = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true))

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1"> <v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

Sheets sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>() ?? workbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets()); string relationshipId = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart);

// Get a unique ID for the new worksheet. uint sheetId = 1; if (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() > 0) { sheetId = (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Select(s => s.SheetId?.Value).Max() + 1) ?? (uint)sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() + 1; }

// Give the new worksheet a name. string sheetName = "Sheet" + sheetId;

// Append the new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = relationshipId, SheetId = sheetId, Name = sheetName }; sheets.Append(sheet); } }

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1">

<c r="A1"> <v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

<v/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue The value of a cell.

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the SpreadsheetDocument document for editing, the code inserts a blank Worksheet object into a SpreadsheetDocument document package. Then, inserts a new Cell object into the new worksheet and inserts the specified text into that cell.

C#

C#

// Given a document name and text, // inserts a new work sheet and writes the text to cell "A1" of the new worksheet. static void InsertText(string docName, string text) { // Open the document for editing. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadSheet = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true)) { WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadSheet.WorkbookPart ?? spreadSheet.AddWorkbookPart();

// Get the SharedStringTablePart. If it does not exist, create a new one. SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart; if (workbookPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart>().Count() > 0) { shareStringPart = workbookPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart>().First(); } else { shareStringPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<SharedStringTablePart>(); }

// Insert the text into the SharedStringTablePart. int index = InsertSharedStringItem(text, shareStringPart);

// Insert a new worksheet. WorksheetPart worksheetPart = InsertWorksheet(workbookPart);

// Insert cell A1 into the new worksheet. Cell cell = InsertCellInWorksheet("A", 1, worksheetPart);

// Set the value of cell A1. cell.CellValue = new CellValue(index.ToString()); cell.DataType = new EnumValue<CellValues> (CellValues.SharedString); } }

The code passes in a parameter that represents the text to insert into the cell and a parameter that represents the SharedStringTablePart object for the spreadsheet. If the ShareStringTablePart object does not contain a SharedStringTable object, the code creates one. If the text already exists in the ShareStringTable object, the code returns the index for the SharedStringItem object that represents the text. Otherwise, it creates a new SharedStringItem object that represents the text.

The following code verifies if the specified text exists in the SharedStringTablePart object and add the text if it does not exist.

C#

C#

// Given text and a SharedStringTablePart, creates a SharedStringItem with the specified text // and inserts it into the SharedStringTablePart. If the item already exists, returns its index. static int InsertSharedStringItem(string text, SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart) { // If the part does not contain a SharedStringTable, create one. shareStringPart.SharedStringTable ??= new SharedStringTable();

int i = 0;

// Iterate through all the items in the SharedStringTable. If the text already exists, return its index. foreach (SharedStringItem item in shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.Elements<SharedStringItem>()) { if (item.InnerText == text) { return i; }

i++; }

// The text does not exist in the part. Create the SharedStringItem and return its index. shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.AppendChild(new SharedStringItem(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Text(text)));

return i; }

The code adds a new WorksheetPart object to the WorkbookPart object by using the AddNewPart method. It then adds a new Worksheet object to the WorksheetPart object, and gets a unique ID for the new worksheet by selecting the maximum SheetId object used within the spreadsheet document and adding one to create the new sheet ID. It gives the worksheet a name by concatenating the word "Sheet" with the sheet ID. It then appends the new Sheet object to the Sheets collection.

The following code inserts a new Worksheet object by adding a new WorksheetPart object to the WorkbookPart object.

C#

C#

// Given a WorkbookPart, inserts a new worksheet. static WorksheetPart InsertWorksheet(WorkbookPart workbookPart) { // Add a new worksheet part to the workbook. WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>(); newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

Sheets sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>() ?? workbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets()); string relationshipId = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart);

// Get a unique ID for the new sheet. uint sheetId = 1; if (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() > 0) { sheetId = sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Select<Sheet, uint>(s => { if (s.SheetId is not null && s.SheetId.HasValue) { return s.SheetId.Value; }

return 0; }).Max() + 1; }

string sheetName = "Sheet" + sheetId;

// Append the new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = relationshipId, SheetId = sheetId, Name = sheetName }; sheets.Append(sheet);

return newWorksheetPart; }

To insert a cell into a worksheet, the code determines where to insert the new cell in the column by iterating through the row elements to find the cell that comes directly after the specified row, in sequential order. It saves that row in the refCell variable. It then inserts the new cell before the cell referenced by refCell using the InsertBefore method.

In the following code, insert a new Cell object into a Worksheet object.

C#

C#

// Given a column name, a row index, and a WorksheetPart, inserts a cell into the worksheet. // If the cell already exists, returns it. static Cell InsertCellInWorksheet(string columnName, uint rowIndex, WorksheetPart worksheetPart) { Worksheet worksheet = worksheetPart.Worksheet; SheetData? sheetData = worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData>(); string cellReference = columnName + rowIndex;

// If the worksheet does not contain a row with the specified row index, insert one. Row row;

if (sheetData?.Elements<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex == rowIndex).Count() != 0) { row = sheetData!.Elements<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex is not null && r.RowIndex == rowIndex).First(); } else { row = new Row() { RowIndex = rowIndex }; sheetData.Append(row); }

// If there is not a cell with the specified column name, insert one. if (row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference is not null && c.CellReference.Value == columnName + rowIndex).Count() > 0) { return row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference is not null && c.CellReference.Value == cellReference).First(); }

else { // Cells must be in sequential order according to CellReference. Determine where to insert the new cell. Cell? refCell = null;

foreach (Cell cell in row.Elements<Cell>()) { if (string.Compare(cell.CellReference?.Value, cellReference, true) > 0) { refCell = cell; break; } }

Cell newCell = new Cell() { CellReference = cellReference }; row.InsertBefore(newCell, refCell);

return newCell; } }

} else { shareStringPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<SharedStringTablePart>(); }

// Insert the text into the SharedStringTablePart. int index = InsertSharedStringItem(text, shareStringPart);

// Insert a new worksheet. WorksheetPart worksheetPart = InsertWorksheet(workbookPart);

// Insert cell A1 into the new worksheet. Cell cell = InsertCellInWorksheet("A", 1, worksheetPart);

// Set the value of cell A1. cell.CellValue = new CellValue(index.ToString()); cell.DataType = new EnumValue<CellValues> (CellValues.SharedString); } }

// If there is not a cell with the specified column name, insert one. if (row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference is not null && c.CellReference.Value == columnName + rowIndex).Count() > 0) { return row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference is not null && c.CellReference.Value == cellReference).First(); } else { // Cells must be in sequential order according to CellReference. Determine where to insert the new cell. Cell? refCell = null;

foreach (Cell cell in row.Elements<Cell>()) { if (string.Compare(cell.CellReference?.Value, cellReference, true) > 0) { refCell = cell; break; } }

Cell newCell = new Cell() { CellReference = cellReference }; row.InsertBefore(newCell, refCell);

return newCell; } }

# Merge two adjacent cells in a

# spreadsheet document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to merge two adjacent cells in a spreadsheet document programmatically.

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the SpreadsheetDocument class represents an Excel document package. To open and work with an Excel document, you create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the document. After you create the instance from the document, you can then obtain access to the main workbook part that contains the worksheets. The text in the document is represented in the package as XML using SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance from the document that you call one of the Open methods. Several are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the Open(String, Boolean) method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to open. The second parameter is either true or false and represents whether you want the file to be opened for editing. Any changes that you make to the document will not be saved if this parameter is false .

## Basic structure of a spreadsheetML document

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the workbook. A separate XML file is created for each worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a Workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships

"> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is shown in the following code example.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1"> <v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetMLOpen XML SDK Class Description Element

<sheets/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.Sheets The container for the block level structures such as sheet, fileVersion, and others

SpreadsheetMLOpen XML SDK Class Description Element

specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<sheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Sheet A sheet that points to a sheet definition file.

<worksheet/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.A sheet definition file Worksheetthat contains the sheet data.

<sheetData/> DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet.SheetData The cell table, grouped together by rows.

<row/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Row A row in the cell table.

<c/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.CellValue The value of a cell.

## How the Sample Code Works

After you have opened the spreadsheet file for editing, the code verifies that the specified cells exist, and if they do not exist, it creates them by calling the CreateSpreadsheetCellIfNotExist method and append it to the appropriate Row object.

C#

C#

// Given a Worksheet and a cell name, verifies that the specified cell exists. // If it does not exist, creates a new cell. static void CreateSpreadsheetCellIfNotExist(Worksheet worksheet, string cellName) { string columnName = GetColumnName(cellName); uint rowIndex = GetRowIndex(cellName);

IEnumerable<Row> rows = worksheet.Descendants<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex?.Value == rowIndex);

// If the Worksheet does not contain the specified row, create the specified row. // Create the specified cell in that row, and insert the row into the Worksheet.

if (rows.Count() == 0) { Row row = new Row() { RowIndex = new UInt32Value(rowIndex) }; Cell cell = new Cell() { CellReference = new StringValue(cellName) }; row.Append(cell); worksheet.Descendants<SheetData>().First().Append(row); } else { Row row = rows.First();

IEnumerable<Cell> cells = row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference?.Value == cellName);

// If the row does not contain the specified cell, create the specified cell. if (cells.Count() == 0) { Cell cell = new Cell() { CellReference = new StringValue(cellName) }; row.Append(cell); } } }

In order to get a column name, the code creates a new regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. This regular expression matches any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters. For more information about regular expressions, see Regular Expression Language Elements. The code gets the column name by calling the Regex.Match.

C#

C#

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the column name. static string GetColumnName(string cellName) { // Create a regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex("[A-Za-z]+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return match.Value; }

To get the row index, the code creates a new regular expression to match the row index portion of the cell name. This regular expression matches any combination of decimal digits. The following code creates a regular expression to match the row index portion of the cell name, comprised of decimal digits.

C#

C#

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the row index. static uint GetRowIndex(string cellName) { // Create a regular expression to match the row index portion the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex(@"\d+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return uint.Parse(match.Value); }

## Sample Code

The following code merges two adjacent cells in a Row document package. When merging two cells, only the content from one of the cells is preserved. In left-to-right languages, the content in the upper-left cell is preserved. In right-to-left languages, the content in the upper-right cell is preserved.

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void MergeTwoCells(string docName, string sheetName, string cell1Name, string cell2Name) { // Open the document for editing. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(docName, true)) { Worksheet? worksheet = GetWorksheet(document, sheetName); if (worksheet is null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(cell1Name) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(cell2Name)) { return; }

// Verify if the specified cells exist, and if they do not exist, create them. CreateSpreadsheetCellIfNotExist(worksheet, cell1Name); CreateSpreadsheetCellIfNotExist(worksheet, cell2Name);

MergeCells mergeCells; if (worksheet.Elements<MergeCells>().Count() > 0) { mergeCells = worksheet.Elements<MergeCells>().First(); } else { mergeCells = new MergeCells();

// Insert a MergeCells object into the specified position. if (worksheet.Elements<CustomSheetView>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<CustomSheetView>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<DataConsolidate>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<DataConsolidate>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<SortState>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<SortState>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<AutoFilter>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<AutoFilter>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<Scenarios>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<Scenarios>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<ProtectedRanges>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<ProtectedRanges>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<SheetProtection>().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<SheetProtection>().First()); } else if (worksheet.Elements<SheetCalculationProperties> ().Count() > 0) { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells,

worksheet.Elements<SheetCalculationProperties>().First()); } else { worksheet.InsertAfter(mergeCells, worksheet.Elements<SheetData>().First()); } }

// Create the merged cell and append it to the MergeCells collection. MergeCell mergeCell = new MergeCell() { Reference = new StringValue(cell1Name + ":" + cell2Name) }; mergeCells.Append(mergeCell); } }

// Given a Worksheet and a cell name, verifies that the specified cell exists. // If it does not exist, creates a new cell. static void CreateSpreadsheetCellIfNotExist(Worksheet worksheet, string cellName) { string columnName = GetColumnName(cellName); uint rowIndex = GetRowIndex(cellName);

IEnumerable<Row> rows = worksheet.Descendants<Row>().Where(r => r.RowIndex?.Value == rowIndex);

// If the Worksheet does not contain the specified row, create the specified row. // Create the specified cell in that row, and insert the row into the Worksheet. if (rows.Count() == 0) { Row row = new Row() { RowIndex = new UInt32Value(rowIndex) }; Cell cell = new Cell() { CellReference = new StringValue(cellName) }; row.Append(cell); worksheet.Descendants<SheetData>().First().Append(row); } else { Row row = rows.First();

IEnumerable<Cell> cells = row.Elements<Cell>().Where(c => c.CellReference?.Value == cellName);

// If the row does not contain the specified cell, create the specified cell. if (cells.Count() == 0) { Cell cell = new Cell() { CellReference = new StringValue(cellName) }; row.Append(cell);

} } }

// Given a SpreadsheetDocument and a worksheet name, get the specified worksheet. static Worksheet? GetWorksheet(SpreadsheetDocument document, string worksheetName) { WorkbookPart workbookPart = document.WorkbookPart ?? document.AddWorkbookPart(); IEnumerable<Sheet> sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet> ().Where(s => s.Name == worksheetName);

string? id = sheets.First().Id; WorksheetPart? worksheetPart = id is not null ? (WorksheetPart)workbookPart.GetPartById(id) : null;

return worksheetPart?.Worksheet; }

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the column name. static string GetColumnName(string cellName) { // Create a regular expression to match the column name portion of the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex("[A-Za-z]+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return match.Value; }

// Given a cell name, parses the specified cell to get the row index. static uint GetRowIndex(string cellName) { // Create a regular expression to match the row index portion the cell name. Regex regex = new Regex(@"\d+"); Match match = regex.Match(cellName);

return uint.Parse(match.Value); }

# Open a spreadsheet document for read-

# only access

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to open a spreadsheet document for read-only access programmatically.

## When to Open a Document for Read-Only

## Access

Sometimes you want to open a document to inspect or retrieve some information, and you want to do this in a way that ensures the document remains unchanged. In these instances, you want to open the document for read-only access. This How To topic discusses several ways to programmatically open a read-only spreadsheet document.

## The SpreadsheetDocument Object

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the Workbook. A separate XML file is created for each Worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is as follows.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData. sheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row

contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is as follows.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1"> <v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

<row/> Row A row in the cell table.

SpreadsheetMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<c/> Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> CellValue The value of a cell.

## Getting a SpreadsheetDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the SpreadsheetDocument class represents an Excel document package. To create an Excel document, you create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a workbook part that serves as a container for the document, and at least one worksheet part. The text is represented in the package as XML using SpreadsheetML markup.

To create the class instance from the document that you call one of the Open overload methods. Several Open methods are provided, each with a different signature. The methods that let you specify whether a document is editable are listed in the following table.

ﾉ Expand table

Open Class LibraryDescription Reference Topic

Open(String, Boolean) Open(String, Boolean) Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified file.

Open(Stream, Boolean) Open(Stream, Boolean Create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified IO stream.

Open(String, Boolean,Open(String, Boolean,Create an instance of the OpenSettings)OpenSettings)SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified file.

Open(Stream, Boolean,Open(Stream, Boolean,Create an instance of the OpenSettings)OpenSettings)SpreadsheetDocument class from the specified I/O stream.

The table earlier in this topic lists only those Open methods that accept a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a

document for read-only access, specify False for this parameter.

Notice that two of the Open methods create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class based on a string as the first parameter. The first example in the sample code uses this technique. It uses the first Open method in the table earlier in this topic; with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a string that represents the full path file name from which you want to open the document. The second parameter is either true or false . This example uses false and indicates that you want to open the file as read-only.

The following code example calls the Open Method.

C#

C#

// Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a file path. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filePath, false))

The other two Open methods create an instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class based on an input/output stream. You might use this approach, for example, if you have a Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 application that uses stream input/output, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a document.

The following code example opens a document based on a stream.

C#

C#

// Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a stream. Stream stream = File.Open(filePath, FileMode.Open);

using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, false))

Suppose you have an application that uses the Open XML support in the System.IO.Packaging namespace of the .NET Framework Class Library, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a package as read-only. Whereas the Open XML SDK includes method overloads that accept a Package as the first parameter, there is

not one that takes a Boolean as the second parameter to indicate whether the document should be opened for editing.

The recommended method is to open the package as read-only at first, before creating the instance of the SpreadsheetDocument class, as shown in the second example in the sample code. The following code example performs this operation.

C#

C#

// Open System.IO.Packaging.Package. Package spreadsheetPackage = Package.Open(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

// Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a package. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(spreadsheetPackage))

## Sample Code

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void OpenSpreadsheetDocumentReadonly(string filePath) { // Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a file path. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filePath, false)) { if (spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart is not null) { // Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart. // The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only. WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

// The rest of the code will not be called. } }

// Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a stream. Stream stream = File.Open(filePath, FileMode.Open);

using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, false)) { if (spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart is not null) { // Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart. // The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only. WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

// The rest of the code will not be called. } }

// Open System.IO.Packaging.Package. Package spreadsheetPackage = Package.Open(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);

// Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a package. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(spreadsheetPackage)) { if (spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart is not null) { // Attempt to add a new WorksheetPart. // The call to AddNewPart generates an exception because the file is read-only. WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();

// The rest of the code will not be called. } } }

# Open a spreadsheet document from a

# stream

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to open a spreadsheet document from a stream programmatically.

## When to Open From a Stream

If you have an application, such as Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, that works with documents by using stream input/output, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with one of the documents, this is designed to be easy to do. This is especially true if the document exists and you can open it using the Open XML SDK. However, suppose that the document is an open stream at the point in your code where you must use the SDK to work with it? That is the scenario for this topic. The sample method in the sample code accepts an open stream as a parameter and then adds text to the document behind the stream using the Open XML SDK.

## The SpreadsheetDocument Object

The basic document structure of a SpreadsheetML document consists of the Sheets and Sheet elements, which reference the worksheets in the Workbook. A separate XML file is created for each Worksheet. For example, the SpreadsheetML for a workbook that has two worksheets name MySheet1 and MySheet2 is located in the Workbook.xml file and is as follows.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <workbook xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships "> <sheets> <sheet name="MySheet1" sheetId="1" r:id="rId1" /> <sheet name="MySheet2" sheetId="2" r:id="rId2" /> </sheets> </workbook>

The worksheet XML files contain one or more block level elements such as SheetData. sheetData represents the cell table and contains one or more Row elements. A row contains one or more Cell elements. Each cell contains a CellValue element that represents the value of the cell. For example, the SpreadsheetML for the first worksheet in a workbook, that only has the value 100 in cell A1, is located in the Sheet1.xml file and is as follows.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"> <sheetData> <row r="1"> <c r="A1"> <v>100</v> </c> </row> </sheetData> </worksheet>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content that uses strongly-typed classes that correspond to SpreadsheetML elements. You can find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.Spreadsheet namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the workbook , sheets , sheet , worksheet , and sheetData elements.

SpreadsheetMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<row/> Row A row in the cell table.

<c/> Cell A cell in a row.

<v/> CellValue The value of a cell.

## Generating the SpreadsheetML Markup to Add

## a Worksheet

When you have access to the body of the main document part, you add a worksheet by calling AddNewPart method to create a new WorksheetPart. The following code example adds the new WorksheetPart .

C#

C#

// Add a new worksheet. WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart> (); newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

## Sample Code

In this example, the OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream method can be used to open a spreadsheet document from an already open stream and append some text to it. The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(args[0], FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite)) {

OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream(fileStream); }

Notice that the OpenAddAndAddToSpreadsheetStream method does not close the stream passed to it. The calling code must do that manually or with a using statement.

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void OpenAndAddToSpreadsheetStream(Stream stream) { // Open a SpreadsheetDocument based on a stream. using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, true)) {

if (spreadsheetDocument is not null) { // Get or create the WorkbookPart WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart ?? spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart();

// Add a new worksheet. WorksheetPart newWorksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>(); newWorksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

Workbook workbook = workbookPart.Workbook ?? new Workbook();

if (workbookPart.Workbook is null) { workbookPart.Workbook = workbook; }

Sheets sheets = workbook.GetFirstChild<Sheets>() ?? workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets()); string relationshipId = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(newWorksheetPart);

// Get a unique ID for the new worksheet. uint sheetId = 1;

if (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() > 0) { sheetId = (sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Select(s => s.SheetId?.Value).Max() + 1) ?? (uint)sheets.Elements<Sheet>().Count() +

1; }

// Give the new worksheet a name. string sheetName = "Sheet" + sheetId;

// Append the new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = relationshipId, SheetId = sheetId, Name = sheetName }; sheets.Append(sheet); } } }

## Approaches to Parsing Open XML Files

The Open XML SDK provides two approaches to parsing Open XML files. You can use the SDK Document Object Model (DOM), or the Simple API for XML (SAX) reading and writing features. The SDK DOM is designed to make it easy to query and parse Open XML files by using strongly-typed classes. However, the DOM approach requires loading entire Open XML parts into memory, which can cause an Out of Memory exception when you are working with really large files. Using the SAX approach, you can employ an OpenXMLReader to read the XML in the file one element at a time, without having to load the entire file into memory. Consider using SAX when you need to handle very large files.

The following code segment is used to read a very large Excel file using the DOM approach.

C#

WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart ?? spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First(); SheetData sheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Elements<SheetData> ().First();

string? text;

foreach (Row r in sheetData.Elements<Row>()) { foreach (Cell c in r.Elements<Cell>()) { text = c?.CellValue?.Text; Console.Write(text + " "); } }

The following code segment performs an identical task to the preceding sample (reading a very large Excel file), but uses the SAX approach. This is the recommended approach for reading very large files.

C#

WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart ?? spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();

OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart); string text; while (reader.Read()) { if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue)) { text = reader.GetText(); Console.Write(text + " "); } }

## Sample Code

You can imagine a scenario where you work for a financial company that handles very large Excel spreadsheets. Those spreadsheets are updated daily by analysts and can easily grow to sizes exceeding hundreds of megabytes. You need a solution to read and extract relevant data from every spreadsheet. The following code example contains two methods that correspond to the two approaches, DOM and SAX. The latter technique will avoid memory exceptions when using very large files. To try them, you can call them in your code one after the other or you can call each method separately by commenting the call to the one you would like to exclude.

C#

// Comment one of the following lines to test the method separately. ReadExcelFileDOM(args[0]); // DOM ReadExcelFileSAX(args[0]); // SAX

The following is the complete code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

// The DOM approach. // Note that the code below works only for cells that contain numeric values static void ReadExcelFileDOM(string fileName) { using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart ?? spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First(); SheetData sheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.Elements<SheetData>().First(); string? text;

foreach (Row r in sheetData.Elements<Row>()) { foreach (Cell c in r.Elements<Cell>()) { text = c?.CellValue?.Text; Console.Write(text + " "); } }

Console.WriteLine(); Console.ReadKey(); } }

// The SAX approach. static void ReadExcelFileSAX(string fileName) { using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart ?? spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); WorksheetPart worksheetPart =

workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();

OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart); string text; while (reader.Read()) { if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue)) { text = reader.GetText(); Console.Write(text + " "); } }

Console.WriteLine(); Console.ReadKey(); } }

# Retrieve a dictionary of all named

# ranges in a spreadsheet document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve a dictionary that contains the names and ranges of all defined names in a Microsoft Excel workbook. It contains an example GetDefinedNames method to illustrate this task.

## GetDefinedNames Method

The GetDefinedNames method accepts a single parameter that indicates the name of the document from which to retrieve the defined names. The method returns an Dictionary<TKey,TValue> instance that contains information about the defined names within the specified workbook, which may be empty if there are no defined names.

## How the Code Works

The code opens the spreadsheet document, using the Open method, indicating that the document should be open for read-only access with the final false parameter. Given the open workbook, the code uses the WorkbookPart property to navigate to the main workbook part. The code stores this reference in a variable named wbPart.

C#

// Open the spreadsheet document for read-only access. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { // Retrieve a reference to the workbook part. var wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;

## Retrieving the Defined Names

Given the workbook part, the next step is simple. The code uses the Workbook property of the workbook part to retrieve a reference to the content of the workbook, and then retrieves the DefinedNames collection provided by the Open XML SDK. This property

returns a collection of all of the defined names that are contained within the workbook. If the property returns a non-null value, the code then iterates through the collection, retrieving information about each named part and adding the key name) and value (range description) to the dictionary for each defined name.

C#

// Retrieve a reference to the defined names collection. DefinedNames? definedNames = wbPart?.Workbook?.DefinedNames;

// If there are defined names, add them to the dictionary. if (definedNames is not null) { foreach (DefinedName dn in definedNames) { if (dn?.Name?.Value is not null && dn?.Text is not null) { returnValue.Add(dn.Name.Value, dn.Text); } } }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete GetDefinedNames code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static Dictionary<String, String>GetDefinedNames(String fileName) { // Given a workbook name, return a dictionary of defined names. // The pairs include the range name and a string representing the range. var returnValue = new Dictionary<String, String>();

// Open the spreadsheet document for read-only access. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { // Retrieve a reference to the workbook part. var wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;

// Retrieve a reference to the defined names collection. DefinedNames? definedNames = wbPart?.Workbook?.DefinedNames;

// If there are defined names, add them to the dictionary. if (definedNames is not null) { foreach (DefinedName dn in definedNames) { if (dn?.Name?.Value is not null && dn?.Text is not null) { returnValue.Add(dn.Name.Value, dn.Text); } } }

}

return returnValue; }

# Retrieve a list of the hidden rows or

# columns in a spreadsheet document

Article • 01/10/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve a list of hidden rows or columns in a Microsoft Excel worksheet. It contains an example GetHiddenRowsOrCols method to illustrate this task.

## GetHiddenRowsOrCols Method

You can use the GetHiddenRowsOrCols method to retrieve a list of the hidden rows or columns in a worksheet. The method returns a list of unsigned integers that contain each index for the hidden rows or columns, if the specified worksheet contains any hidden rows or columns (rows and columns are numbered starting at 1, rather than 0). The GetHiddenRowsOrCols method accepts three parameters:

The name of the document to examine (string).

The name of the sheet to examine (string).

Whether to detect rows (true) or columns (false) (Boolean).

## How the Code Works

The code opens the document, by using the method and indicating that the document should be open for read-only access (the final false parameter value). Next the code retrieves a reference to the workbook part, by using the WorkbookPart property of the document.

C#

using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if (document is not null) {

WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart ?? document.AddWorkbookPart();

To find the hidden rows or columns, the code must first retrieve a reference to the specified sheet, given its name. This is not as easy as you might think. The code must look through all the sheet-type descendants of the workbook part's Workbook property, examining the Name property of each sheet that it finds. Note that this search simply looks through the relations of the workbook, and does not actually find a worksheet part. It simply finds a reference to a Sheet object, which contains information such as the name and Id property of the sheet. The simplest way to accomplish this is to use a LINQ query.

C#

Sheet? theSheet = wbPart.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet> ().FirstOrDefault((s) => s.Name == sheetName);

The sheet information you already retrieved provides an Id property, and given that Id property, the code can retrieve a reference to the corresponding WorksheetPart property by calling the GetPartById method of the WorkbookPart object.

C#

// The sheet does exist. WorksheetPart? wsPart = wbPart.GetPartById(theSheet.Id!) as WorksheetPart; Worksheet? ws = wsPart?.Worksheet;

## Retrieving the List of Hidden Row or Column

## Index Values

The code uses the detectRows parameter that you specified when you called the method to determine whether to retrieve information about rows or columns.The code that actually retrieves the list of hidden rows requires only a single line of code.

C#

// Retrieve hidden rows. itemList = ws.Descendants<Row>() .Where((r) => r?.Hidden is not null && r.Hidden.Value) .Select(r => r.RowIndex?.Value) .Cast<uint>() .ToList();

Retrieving the list of hidden columns is a bit trickier, because Excel collapses groups of hidden columns into a single element, and provides Min and Max properties that describe the first and last columns in the group. Therefore, the code that retrieves the list of hidden columns starts the same as the code that retrieves hidden rows. However, it must iterate through the index values (looping each item in the collection of hidden columns, adding each index from the Min to the Max value, inclusively).

C#

var cols = ws.Descendants<Column>().Where((c) => c?.Hidden is not null && c.Hidden.Value);

foreach (Column item in cols) { if (item.Min is not null && item.Max is not null) { for (uint i = item.Min.Value; i <= item.Max.Value; i++) { itemList.Add(i); } } }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete GetHiddenRowsOrCols code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static List<uint> GetHiddenRowsOrCols(string fileName, string sheetName, string detectRows = "false") { // Given a workbook and a worksheet name, return // either a list of hidden row numbers, or a list

// of hidden column numbers. If detectRows is true, return // hidden rows. If detectRows is false, return hidden columns. // Rows and columns are numbered starting with 1. List<uint> itemList = new List<uint>();

using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if (document is not null) { WorkbookPart wbPart = document.WorkbookPart ?? document.AddWorkbookPart();

Sheet? theSheet = wbPart.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet> ().FirstOrDefault((s) => s.Name == sheetName);

if (theSheet is null || theSheet.Id is null) { throw new ArgumentException("sheetName"); } else {

// The sheet does exist. WorksheetPart? wsPart = wbPart.GetPartById(theSheet.Id!) as WorksheetPart; Worksheet? ws = wsPart?.Worksheet;

if (ws is not null) { if (detectRows.ToLower() == "true") { // Retrieve hidden rows. itemList = ws.Descendants<Row>() .Where((r) => r?.Hidden is not null && r.Hidden.Value) .Select(r => r.RowIndex?.Value) .Cast<uint>() .ToList(); } else { // Retrieve hidden columns. var cols = ws.Descendants<Column>().Where((c) => c?.Hidden is not null && c.Hidden.Value);

foreach (Column item in cols) { if (item.Min is not null && item.Max is not null) { for (uint i = item.Min.Value; i <= item.Max.Value; i++) { itemList.Add(i);

} } } } } } } }

return itemList; }

# Retrieve a list of the hidden worksheets

# in a spreadsheet document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve a list of hidden worksheets in a Microsoft Excel workbook, without loading the document into Excel. It contains an example GetHiddenSheets method to illustrate this task.

## GetHiddenSheets method

You can use the GetHiddenSheets method, to retrieve a list of the hidden worksheets in a workbook. The GetHiddenSheets method accepts a single parameter, a string that indicates the path of the file that you want to examine. The method works with the workbook you specify, filling a List<T> instance with a reference to each hidden Sheet object.

## Retrieve the collection of worksheets

The WorkbookPart class provides a Workbook property, which in turn contains the XML content of the workbook. Although the Open XML SDK provides the Sheets property, which returns a collection of the Sheet parts, all the information that you need is provided by the Sheet elements within the Workbook XML content. The following code uses the Descendants generic method of the Workbook object to retrieve a collection of Sheet objects that contain information about all the sheet child elements of the workbook's XML content.

C#

WorkbookPart? wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;

if (wbPart is not null) { var sheets = wbPart.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>();

## Retrieve hidden sheets

It's important to be aware that Excel supports two levels of worksheets. You can hide a worksheet by using the Excel user interface by right-clicking the worksheets tab and opting to hide the worksheet. For these worksheets, the State property of the Sheet object contains an enumerated value of Hidden . You can also make a worksheet very hidden by writing code (either in VBA or in another language) that sets the sheet's Visible property to the enumerated value xlSheetVeryHidden . For worksheets hidden in this manner, the State property of the Sheet object contains the enumerated value VeryHidden .

Given the collection that contains information about all the sheets, the following code uses the Where function to filter the collection so that it contains only the sheets in which the State property is not null. If the State property is not null, the code looks for the Sheet objects in which the State property as a value, and where the value is either SheetStateValues.Hidden or SheetStateValues.VeryHidden .

C#

var hiddenSheets = sheets.Where((item) => item.State is not null && item.State.HasValue && (item.State.Value == SheetStateValues.Hidden || item.State.Value == SheetStateValues.VeryHidden));

## Sample code

The following is the complete GetHiddenSheets code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static List<Sheet> GetHiddenSheets(string fileName) { List<Sheet> returnVal = new List<Sheet>();

using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { WorkbookPart? wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;

if (wbPart is not null) { var sheets = wbPart.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>();

// Look for sheets where there is a State attribute defined,

// where the State has a value, // and where the value is either Hidden or VeryHidden.

var hiddenSheets = sheets.Where((item) => item.State is not null && item.State.HasValue && (item.State.Value == SheetStateValues.Hidden || item.State.Value == SheetStateValues.VeryHidden));

returnVal = hiddenSheets.ToList(); } }

return returnVal; }

# Retrieve the values of cells in a

# spreadsheet document

Article • 01/10/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve the values of cells in a spreadsheet document. It contains an example GetCellValue method to illustrate this task.

## GetCellValue Method

You can use the GetCellValue method to retrieve the value of a cell in a workbook. The method requires the following three parameters:

A string that contains the name of the document to examine.

A string that contains the name of the sheet to examine.

A string that contains the cell address (such as A1, B12) from which to retrieve a value.

The method returns the value of the specified cell, if it could be found. The following code example shows the method signature.

C#

C#

static string GetCellValue(string fileName, string sheetName, string addressName)

## How the Code Works

The code starts by creating a variable to hold the return value, and initializes it to null.

C#

C#

string? value = null;

## Accessing the Cell

Next, the code opens the document by using the Open method, indicating that the document should be open for read-only access (the final false parameter). Next, the code retrieves a reference to the workbook part by using the WorkbookPart property of the document.

C#

C#

// Open the spreadsheet document for read-only access. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { // Retrieve a reference to the workbook part. WorkbookPart? wbPart = document.WorkbookPart;

To find the requested cell, the code must first retrieve a reference to the sheet, given its name. The code must search all the sheet-type descendants of the workbook part workbook element and examine the Name property of each sheet that it finds. Be aware that this search looks through the relations of the workbook, and does not actually find a worksheet part. It finds a reference to a Sheet, which contains information such as the name and Id of the sheet. The simplest way to do this is to use a LINQ query, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// Find the sheet with the supplied name, and then use that // Sheet object to retrieve a reference to the first worksheet. Sheet? theSheet = wbPart?.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>().Where(s => s.Name == sheetName).FirstOrDefault();

// Throw an exception if there is no sheet. if (theSheet is null || theSheet.Id is null) {

throw new ArgumentException("sheetName"); }

Be aware that the FirstOrDefault method returns either the first matching reference (a sheet, in this case) or a null reference if no match was found. The code checks for the null reference, and throws an exception if you passed in an invalid sheet name.Now that you have information about the sheet, the code must retrieve a reference to the corresponding worksheet part. The sheet information that you already retrieved provides an Id property, and given that Id property, the code can retrieve a reference to the corresponding WorksheetPart by calling the workbook part GetPartById method.

C#

C#

// Retrieve a reference to the worksheet part. WorksheetPart wsPart = (WorksheetPart)wbPart!.GetPartById(theSheet.Id!);

Just as when locating the named sheet, when locating the named cell, the code uses the Descendants method, searching for the first match in which the CellReference property equals the specified addressName parameter. After this method call, the variable named theCell will either contain a reference to the cell, or will contain a null reference.

C#

C#

// Use its Worksheet property to get a reference to the cell // whose address matches the address you supplied. Cell? theCell = wsPart.Worksheet?.Descendants<Cell>()?.Where(c => c.CellReference == addressName).FirstOrDefault();

## Retrieving the Value

At this point, the variable named theCell contains either a null reference, or a reference to the cell that you requested. If you examine the Open XML content (that is, theCell.OuterXml ) for the cell, you will find XML such as the following.

XML

<x:c r="A1"> <x:v>12.345000000000001</x:v> </x:c>

The InnerText property contains the content for the cell, and so the next block of code retrieves this value.

C#

C#

// If the cell does not exist, return an empty string. if (theCell is null || theCell.InnerText.Length < 0) { return string.Empty; } value = theCell.InnerText;

Now, the sample method must interpret the value. As it is, the code handles numeric and date, string, and Boolean values. You can extend the sample as necessary. The Cell type provides a DataType property that indicates the type of the data within the cell. The value of the DataType property is null for numeric and date types. It contains the value CellValues.SharedString for strings, and CellValues.Boolean for Boolean values. If the DataType property is null, the code returns the value of the cell (it is a numeric value). Otherwise, the code continues by branching based on the data type.

C#

C#

// If the cell represents an integer number, you are done. // For dates, this code returns the serialized value that // represents the date. The code handles strings and // Booleans individually. For shared strings, the code // looks up the corresponding value in the shared string // table. For Booleans, the code converts the value into // the words TRUE or FALSE. if (theCell.DataType is not null) { if (theCell.DataType.Value == CellValues.SharedString) {

If the DataType property contains CellValues.SharedString , the code must retrieve a reference to the single SharedStringTablePart.

C#

C#

// For shared strings, look up the value in the // shared strings table. var stringTable = wbPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart> ().FirstOrDefault();

Next, if the string table exists (and if it does not, the workbook is damaged and the sample code returns the index into the string table instead of the string itself) the code returns the InnerText property of the element it finds at the specified index (first converting the value property to an integer).

C#

C#

// If the shared string table is missing, something // is wrong. Return the index that is in // the cell. Otherwise, look up the correct text in // the table. if (stringTable is not null) { value = stringTable.SharedStringTable.ElementAt(int.Parse(value)).InnerText; }

If the DataType property contains CellValues.Boolean , the code converts the 0 or 1 it finds in the cell value into the appropriate text string.

C#

C#

switch (value) { case "0": value = "FALSE"; break; default:

value = "TRUE"; break; }

Finally, the procedure returns the variable value , which contains the requested information.

## Sample Code

The following is the complete GetCellValue code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static string GetCellValue(string fileName, string sheetName, string addressName) { string? value = null; // Open the spreadsheet document for read-only access. using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { // Retrieve a reference to the workbook part. WorkbookPart? wbPart = document.WorkbookPart; // Find the sheet with the supplied name, and then use that // Sheet object to retrieve a reference to the first worksheet. Sheet? theSheet = wbPart?.Workbook.Descendants<Sheet>().Where(s => s.Name == sheetName).FirstOrDefault();

// Throw an exception if there is no sheet. if (theSheet is null || theSheet.Id is null) { throw new ArgumentException("sheetName"); } // Retrieve a reference to the worksheet part. WorksheetPart wsPart = (WorksheetPart)wbPart!.GetPartById(theSheet.Id!); // Use its Worksheet property to get a reference to the cell // whose address matches the address you supplied. Cell? theCell = wsPart.Worksheet?.Descendants<Cell>()?.Where(c => c.CellReference == addressName).FirstOrDefault(); // If the cell does not exist, return an empty string. if (theCell is null || theCell.InnerText.Length < 0) { return string.Empty; } value = theCell.InnerText; // If the cell represents an integer number, you are done.

// For dates, this code returns the serialized value that // represents the date. The code handles strings and // Booleans individually. For shared strings, the code // looks up the corresponding value in the shared string // table. For Booleans, the code converts the value into // the words TRUE or FALSE. if (theCell.DataType is not null) { if (theCell.DataType.Value == CellValues.SharedString) { // For shared strings, look up the value in the // shared strings table. var stringTable = wbPart.GetPartsOfType<SharedStringTablePart>().FirstOrDefault(); // If the shared string table is missing, something // is wrong. Return the index that is in // the cell. Otherwise, look up the correct text in // the table. if (stringTable is not null) { value = stringTable.SharedStringTable.ElementAt(int.Parse(value)).InnerText; } } else if (theCell.DataType.Value == CellValues.Boolean) { switch (value) { case "0": value = "FALSE"; break; default: value = "TRUE"; break; } } } }

return value; }

Article • 01/10/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve a list of the worksheets in a Microsoft Excel workbook, without loading the document into Excel. It contains an example GetAllWorksheets method to illustrate this task.

## GetAllWorksheets Method

You can use the GetAllWorksheets method, which is shown in the following code, to retrieve a list of the worksheets in a workbook. The GetAllWorksheets method accepts a single parameter, a string that indicates the path of the file that you want to examine.

C#

Sheets? sheets = GetAllWorksheets(args[0]);

The method works with the workbook you specify, returning an instance of the Sheets object, from which you can retrieve a reference to each Sheet object.

## Calling the GetAllWorksheets Method

To call the GetAllWorksheets method, pass the required value, as shown in the following code.

C#

Sheets? sheets = GetAllWorksheets(args[0]);

if (sheets is not null) { foreach (Sheet sheet in sheets) { Console.WriteLine(sheet.Name);

} }

## How the Code Works

The sample method, GetAllWorksheets , creates a variable that will contain a reference to the Sheets collection of the workbook. At the end of its work, the method returns the variable, which contains either a reference to the Sheets collection, or null / Nothing if there were no sheets (this cannot occur in a well-formed workbook).

C#

Sheets? theSheets = null;

The code then continues by opening the document in read-only mode, and retrieving a reference to the WorkbookPart.

C#

using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { theSheets = document?.WorkbookPart?.Workbook.Sheets;

To get access to the Workbook object, the code retrieves the value of the Workbook property from the WorkbookPart , and then retrieves a reference to the Sheets object from the Sheets property of the Workbook . The Sheets object contains the collection of Sheet objects that provide the method's return value.

C#

theSheets = document?.WorkbookPart?.Workbook.Sheets;

## Sample Code

The following is the complete GetAllWorksheets code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static Sheets? GetAllWorksheets(string fileName) { Sheets? theSheets = null;

using (SpreadsheetDocument document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { theSheets = document?.WorkbookPart?.Workbook.Sheets; }

return theSheets; }

# Working with the calculation chain

Article • 01/14/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK CalculationChain class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document.

## CalculationChain in SpreadsheetML

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the CalculationChain ( <calcChain/> ) element.

An instance of this part type contains an ordered set of references to all cells in all worksheets in the workbook whose value is calculated from any formula. The ordering allows inter-related cell formulas to be calculated in the correct order when a worksheet is loaded for use.

A package shall contain no more than one Calculation Chain part.

The root element for a part of this content type shall be calcChain.

The Calculation Chain part specifies the order in which cells in the workbook were last calculated. It only records information about cells containing formulas. It does not include any information about the formula-dependency calculation tree. In other words, the Calculation Chain part does not indicate the dependencies that formulas have on other cell values; it only indicates the order in which the cells were last calculated.

Any particular calculation event can cause the calculation chain order to be rearranged or altered. For example, adding more formulas to the workbook adds references in the Calculation Chain part.

Another example of how the calculation order can be updated involves the idea of partial calculation. Partial calculation is an optimization a spreadsheet application can implement to calculate only those cells that are dependent on other cells whose values have changed, and to ignore other formulas in the workbook. This helps to avoid redundantly recalculating results that are already known. Therefore, if a set of formulas that were previously ignored during a calculation become required for calculation (due to a cell's value changing), then these formulas move to "first" on the calculation chain so they can be evaluated.

While calculation chain information can be loaded by a spreadsheet application, it is not required. A calculation chain can be constructed in memory at load-time based on the formulas and their interdependence, if the spreadsheet application finds this information useful. The order expressed in the Calculation Chain part does not force or dictate to the implementing application the order in which calculations must be performed at runtime.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists the common Open XML SDK classes used when working with the CalculationChain class.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetML Element Open XML SDK Class

## Open XML SDK CalculationChain Class

The Open XML SDK CalculationChain class represents the paragraph ( <calcChain/> ) element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for SpreadsheetML documents. Use the CalculationChain class to manipulate individual <calcChain/> elements in a SpreadsheetML document.

### Calculation Cell Class

The CalculationCell class represents the cell ( <c/> ) element that represents a cell that contains a formula.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the CalculationCell ( <c/> ) element.

Every c element represents a cell containing a formula. The first cell calculated appears first (top-to-bottom), and so on. The reference attribute r indicates the cell's address in the sheet. The index attribute i indicates the index of the sheet with which that cell is associated.

# Working with conditional formatting

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK ConditionalFormatting class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document.

## Conditional Formatting in SpreadsheetML

Cell based conditional formatting provides structure to data inside a worksheet. Showing colors, in addition to showing a value, helps distinguish the relative height of those values. There are several formatting options you can apply to cells based on their value. You can highlight the top or bottom most items, provide data bars to show a progress bar type user interface, or use color scales to indicate the highs and lows. Conditional formatting is applicable to a cell in a worksheet directly. The value does not have to be part of a table.

All conditional formatting settings are stored at the worksheet level. The worksheet stores one <conditionalFormatting/> element for each format applied to a cell or series of cells. The collection of cells on which the format is applied is defined using the sqref attribute. The sqref attribute specifies a cell range using the 'from:to' notation, for example 'A1:A10'.

The following table lists the common Open XML SDK classes used when working with the ConditionalFormatting class.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetML Element Open XML SDK Class

<cfRule/> ConditionalFormattingRule

<dataBar/> DataBar

<colorScale/> ColorScale

<iconSet/> IconSet

## Open XML SDK Conditional Formatting Class

The Open XML SDK ConditionalFormatting class represents the table ( <conditionalFormatting/> ) element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for SpreadsheetML documents. Use the ConditionalFormatting class to manipulate individual <conditionalFormatting/> elements in a SpreadsheetML document.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the ConditionalFormatting ( <conditionalFormatting/> ) element.

A Conditional Format is a format, such as cell shading or font color, that a spreadsheet application can automatically apply to cells if a specified condition is true. This collection expresses conditional formatting rules applied to a particular cell or range.

Example: This example applies a 'top10' rule to the cells C3:C8. The @dxfId references the formatting (defined in the styles part) to be applied to cells that match the criteria.

XML

<conditionalFormatting sqref="C3:C8"> <cfRule type="top10" dxfId="1" priority="3" rank="2"/> </conditionalFormatting>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Conditional Formatting Rule Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the ConditionalFormattingRule ( <cfRule/> ) element.

This collection represents a description of a conditional formatting rule.

Example:

This example shows a conditional formatting rule highlighting cells whose values are greater than 0.5. Note that in this case the content of <formula/> is a static value, but can also be a formula expression.

XML

<conditionalFormatting sqref="E3:E9"> <cfRule type="cellIs" dxfId="0" priority="1" operator="greaterThan"> <formula>0.5</formula>

</cfRule> <conditionalFormatting>

Only rules with a type attribute value of expression support formula syntax.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

Each conditional format is allowed to specify various formatting rules. You can apply color scale and data bar formatting at the same time for instance. Each conditional format is represented using a separate <cfRule/> element. To specify their user interface display priority you can use the priority attribute. Because a <conditionalFormatting/> element can overlap other formatted areas on the worksheet the priority is global for all the conditional formats defined for that worksheet.

The <cfRule/> element has many formatting types, such as cellIs and top10 , which can be applied. Each type of formatting uses common elements to define its settings. For more information about conditional formatting rule attributes, see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

### Data Bar Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the DataBar ( <dataBar/> ) element.

Describes a data bar conditional formatting rule.

Example:

In this example a data bar conditional format is expressed, which spreads across all cell values in the cell range, and whose color is blue.

XML

<dataBar> <cfvo type="min" val="0"/> <cfvo type="max" val="0"/> <color rgb="FF638EC6"/> </dataBar>

The length of the data bar for any cell can be calculated as follows:

Data bar length = minLength + (cell value - minimum value in the range) / (maximum value in the range - minimum value in the range) * (maxLength - minLength),

where min and max length are a fixed percentage of the column width (by default, 10% and 90% respectively.)

The minimum difference in length (or increment amount) is 1 pixel.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

Data bars take a single color and display it as a bar. The length of the bar indicates the relative height of the cell value. A data bar uses a separate model inside the conditional formatting rule to define its settings. The <dataBar/> element stores all the relevant data. A data bar requires three settings: the minimum and maximum values to compare cell values to, and a color. The first <cfvo/> element, or conditional format value object, defines the minimum value, the second <cfvo/> elements defines the maximum value. You can use different ways to specify a value, like using a formula or hard-coded value. Another common option is to use the 'min' and 'max' types. These <cfvo/> element types specify the minimum and maximum values found in the cell range that have the format applied. This provides a clean stepped gradient between the lowest and highest items. In addition, you can specify the color of the data bar by using the <color/> element.

### Color Scale Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the ColorScale ( <colorScale/> ) element.

Describes a gradated color scale in this conditional formatting rule.

Example:

XML

<colorScale> <cfvo type="min" val="0"/> <cfvo type="max" val="0"/> <color theme="5"/> <color rgb="FFFFEF9C"/> </colorScale>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

Color scales provide a display that indicates the relative value between all cell items, similar to a data bar. A color scale uses a separate model inside the conditional formatting rule to define its settings. You can specify up to three <cfvo/> , or conditional format value object, element values: one for the start of the scale, one for the middle of

the scale, and one for the end of the scale. The middle value is optional. In addition, you can specify the color of the color scale by using the <color/> element.

### Icon Set Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the IconSet ( <iconSet/> ) element.

Describes an icon set conditional formatting rule.

Example: This example demonstrates the "3Arrows" style of icons. The first icon in the set must be shown if the cell's value is less than the 33rd percentile. The second icon in the set must be shown if the cell's value is less than the 67th percentile, and greater than or equal to the 33rd percentile. The third icon in the set must be shown if the cell's value is greater than or equal to the 67th percentile.

XML

<iconSet iconSet="3Arrows"> <cfvo type="percentile" val="0"/> <cfvo type="percentile" val="33"/> <cfvo type="percentile" val="67"/> </iconSet>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

Using icon sets you can apply different sets of icons to the cells that contain your data. The icon set uses a range of values to identify which set of cells to apply the formatting rule to. The first <cfvo/> element identifies the lowest value of the range, the second <cfvo/> element identifies the middle point, and the third <cfvo/> element identifies the highest value. An icon set identifies which icons to apply to the cells. You can choose from various hard coded icons. For more information about what icons are available, see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

# Working with formulas

Article • 01/14/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK CellFormula class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document (Open XML SDK).

## Formulas in SpreadsheetML

You can use formulas to create computational models. Formulas allow for automatic calculation of values based on data inside and outside the spreadsheet or the output of other computed cells in the spreadsheet.

Formulas are stored inside each cell that uses a formula, in the worksheet XML file. Use the CellFormula ( <f/> >) element to define the formula text. Formulas can contain mathematical expressions that include a wide range of predefined functions.

The CellValue ( <v/> >) element, stores the cached formula value based on the last time the formula was calculated. This allows the user to postpone calculation of the formula values when the spreadsheet is opened, which saves time when opening a worksheet. You do not have to specify the value, and if you omit it, it is the responsibility of the Open XML reader to compute the value based on the formula definition when the worksheet is opened. For more information about the CellValue class, see CellValue.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the cellFormula ( <f/> >) element.

A SpreadsheetML formula is the syntactic representation of a series of calculations that is parsed or interpreted by the spreadsheet application into a function that calculates a value or array of values based upon zero-to-many inputs.

A formula is an expression that can contain the following: constants, operators, cell references, calls to functions, and names.

Example : Consider the formula PI()*(A2^2). In this case,

PI() results in a call to the function PI, which returns the value of π. - The cell reference A2 returns the value in that cell. - 2 is a numeric constant. - The caret (^) operator raises its left operand to the power of its right operand. - The

parentheses, ( and ), are used for grouping. - The asterisk (*) operator performs multiplication of its two operands.

An operator is a symbol that specifies the type of operation to perform on one or more operands. There are arithmetic, comparison, text, and reference operators.

Each set of horizontal cells in a worksheet is a row, and each set of vertical cells is a column. A cell's row and column combination designates the location of that cell.

A cell reference designates one or more cells on the same worksheet. Using references, one can: - Use data contained in different parts of the same worksheet in a single formula. - Use the value from a single cell in several formulas. - Refer to cells on other sheets in the same workbook, and even to other workbooks. (References to cells in other workbooks are called links.)

A function is a named formula that takes zero or more arguments, performs an operation, and, optionally, returns a result. Some examples of function calls are: PI(), POWER(A1,B3), and SUM(C6:C10).

There are more than 300 predefined functions defined by this Office Open XML specification. User-defined functions are also permitted.

A name is an alias for a constant, a cell reference, or a formula. A name in a formula can make it easier to understand the purpose of that formula. For example, the formula SUM(FirstQuarterSales) is easier to identify than SUM(C20:C30).

Each expression has a type. SpreadsheetML formulas support the following types: array, error, logical, number, and text.

An array value or constant represents a collection of one or more elements, whose values can have any type (i.e., the elements of an array need not all have the same type).

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

For more information about formula syntax see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

### SpreadsheetML Example

This example shows the XML for a file that contains one formula, the SUM function, in cell A6 on Sheet1. The following XML defines the worksheet and is contained in the "sheet1.xml" file.

# Working with PivotTables

Article • 01/14/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK PivotTableDefinition class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document.

## PivotTable in SpreadsheetML

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the PivotTableDefinition ( <pivotTableDefinition/> ) element.

PivotTables display aggregated views of data easily and in an understandable layout. Hundreds or thousands of pieces of underlying information can be aggregated on row & column axes, revealing the meanings behind the data. PivotTable reports are used to organize and summarize your data in different ways. Creating a PivotTable report is about moving pieces of information around to see how they fit together. In a few gestures the pivot rows and columns can be moved into different arrangements and layouts.

A PivotTable object has a row axis area, a column axis area, a values area, and a report filter area. Additionally, PivotTables have a corresponding field list pane displaying all the fields of data which can be placed on one of the PivotTable areas.

The workbook points to (and owns the longevity of) the pivotCacheDefinition part, which in turn points to and owns the pivotCacheRecords part. The workbook also points to and owns the sheet part, which in turn points to and owns a pivotTable part definition, when a PivotTable is on the sheet (there can be multiple PivotTables on a sheet). The pivotTable part points to the appropriate pivotCacheDefinition which it is using. Since multiple PivotTables can use the same cache, the pivotTable part does not own the longevity of the pivotCacheDefinition.

The pivotTable part describes the particulars of the layout of the PivotTable on the sheet. It indicates what fields are on the row axis, the column axis, report filter, and values areas of the PivotTable. It also indicates formatting information about the PivotTable. If conditional formatting has been applied to the PivotTable, that is also expressed in the pivotTable part.

The pivot cache definition contains the definitions of all fields in the PivotTable. If you create a PivotTable based on a regular table, each column in the table becomes a field of

the pivot cache definition. The pivot cache contains the field definitions and information about the type of content found in that field. It also maintains a reference to the source data in the cache markup so that the pivot cache can be refreshed along with the cached data in the pivot cache records part.

The data that is displayed in the PivotTable is stored in two locations. The pivot cache records part maintains the actual data for the PivotTable. The table cells in the worksheet also store a cached version of the data, but that is only for display purposes. The pivot cache records part stores data in one of two ways. The unique values for the data area of the PivotTable are cached inline. The repeating items that you normally find on the row and column are referenced. This shared data is actually stored in the pivot cache definition. Each record in the pivot cache record part consists of N values where N is equal to the number of fields defined in the pivot cache definition.

The final step is to create the PivotTable itself. The PivotTable definition part contains the information about which field is present in which place of the PivotTable. You can place a field in four areas: row, column, data or filter. The fields are chosen from the cached fields in the pivot cache definition.

To create a PivotTable that is ready to use when the workbook is opened you also need to create the markup for the table cells. The PivotTable is displayed in the cells of a worksheet and therefore you need to construct them as well. You can also have the user update the PivotTable cells when opening the document.

The following table lists the common Open XML SDK classes used when working with the PivotTableDefinition class.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetML Element Open XML SDK Class

<pivotField/> PivotField

<pivotCacheDefinition/> PivotCacheDefinition

<pivotCacheRecords/> PivotCacheRecords

## Open XML SDK PivotTableDefinition Class

The Open XML SDK PivotTableDefinition class represents the PivotTable definition ( <pivotTableDefinition/> ) element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for SpreadsheetML documents. Use the PivotTableDefinition class to manipulate individual <pivotTableDefinition/> elements in a SpreadsheetML document.

The main function of the PivotTable definition is to store information about which field is displayed on which axis of the PivotTable and in what order. There are many other settings that can be added to the PivotTable definition, but the following explains the basics.

The root element names the PivotTable so that it can be used as a data source. The root element also references the pivot cache by using the ID added to the workbook part, and defines the caption label to display above the data area of the PivotTable. All of these elements are required.

The three main pieces of the PivotTableDefinition are: the location of the table, the display information for the cached fields, and the positioning information of the cached fields. For more information about these and other additional elements that make up the PivotTableDefinition , see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

### PivotField Class

The PivotTableDefinition element contains the PivotField ( <pivotField/> ) elements. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the PivotField ( <pivotField/> ) element.

Represents a single field in the PivotTable. This element contains information about the field, including the collection of items in the field.

First, define the collection of fields that appear on the PivotTable using the pivotFields element. Each field serves as a cache for the data of that field in the data source. You do not need to define the cache. Instead, you can set the item element equal to default and have the user update the table when they open the document. The showAll attribute is used to hide certain elements for that data dimension. After defining which fields are part of the table, the fields are applied to the four areas of the PivotTable.

### Pivot Cache Definition Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the PivotCacheDefinition ( <pivotCacheDefinition/> ) element.

The pivotCacheDefinition part defines each field in the pivotCacheRecords part, including field name and information about the data contained in the field. The pivotCacheDefinition part also defines pivot items that are shared among the pivotTable and pivotRecords parts.

The pivot cache defines the source of the data in the PivotTable, which allows it to be updated, and it defines the list of fields in that data. Be aware that the cache defines all the fields available to the PivotTable, not the ones actually used. The PivotTable definition defines which of the available fields are used by a particular PivotTable.

The data source definition references the data that is displayed in the PivotTable. The PivotTable also maintains the data in the cache-records part to allow the table to be updatable when the data connection is not available. You cannot rely on the cells of the PivotTable to store the data because the data in these cells is transient in nature, it changes when you pivot the table. There are various types of data sources, for example: worksheets, database, OLAP cube, and other PivotTables.

The last part of the cache definition defines the fields of the data source using the cacheField element. The cacheField element is used for two purposes: it defines the data type and formatting of the field, and it is used as a cache for shared strings. The pivot values are stored in the pivot cache records part. When a recurring string is used as a value, the cache record uses a reference into the cacheField collection of shared items.

### Pivot Cache Records Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the PivotCacheRecords ( <pivotCacheRecords/> ) element.

The pivotCacheRecords part contains the underlying data to be aggregated. It is a cache of the source data.

The cache records part can store any number of cached records. Each record has the same number of values defined as there are fields in the cache definition. Each record is defined with the r element. This record contains value items as child elements. You can provide certain typed values, such as Numeric, Boolean, or Date-Time, or you can reference into the shared items.

# Working with the shared string table

Article • 01/14/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK SharedStringTable class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document.

## SharedStringTable in SpreadsheetML

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the SharedStringTable ( <sst/> ) element.

An instance of this part type contains one occurrence of each unique string that occurs on all worksheets in a workbook.

A package shall contain exactly one Shared String Table part

The root element for a part of this content type shall be sst.

A workbook can contain thousands of cells containing string (non-numeric) data. Furthermore, this data is very likely to be repeated across many rows or columns. The goal of implementing a single string table that is shared across the workbook is to improve performance in opening and saving the file by only reading and writing the repetitive information once.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

Shared strings optimize space requirements when the spreadsheet contains multiple instances of the same string. Spreadsheets that contain business or analytical data often contain repeating strings. If these strings were stored using inline string markup, the same markup would appear over and over in the worksheet. While this is a valid approach, there are several downsides. First, the file requires more space on disk because of the redundant content. Moreover, loading and saving also takes longer.

To optimize the use of strings in a spreadsheet, SpreadsheetML stores a single instance of the string in a table, called the shared string table. The cells then reference the string by index instead of storing the value inline in the cell value. Excel always creates a shared string table when it saves a file. However, using the shared string table is not required to create a valid SpreadsheetML file. If you are creating a spreadsheet document programmatically and the spreadsheet contains a small number of strings, or

does not contain any repeating strings, the optimizations usually gained from the shared string table might be negligible in these cases.

The shared strings table is a separate part inside the package. Each workbook contains only one shared string table part that contains strings that can appear multiple times in one sheet or in multiple sheets.

The following table lists the common Open XML SDK classes used when working with the SharedStringTable class.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetML Element Open XML SDK Class

<si/> SharedStringItem

<t/> Text

## Open XML SDK SharedStringTable Class

The Open XML SDK SharedStringTable class represents the paragraph ( <sst/> ) element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for SpreadsheetML documents. Use the SharedStringTable class to manipulate individual <sst/> elements in a SpreadsheetML document.

### Shared String Item Class

The SharedStringItem class represents the shared string item ( <si/> ) element which represents an individual string in the shared string table.

If the string is a simple string with formatting applied at the cell level, then the shared string item contains a single text element used to express the string. However, if the string in the cell is more complex ─ for example, if the string has formatting applied at the character level ─ then the string item consists of multiple rich text runs that are used collectively to express the string.

For example, the following XML code is the shared string table for a worksheet that contains text formatted at the cell level and at the character level. The first three strings ("Cell A1", "Cell B1", and "My Cell") are from cells that are formatted at the cell level and only the text is stored in the shared string table. The next two strings ("Cell A2" and "Cell B2") contain character level formatting. The word "Cell" is formatted differently from

"A2" and "B2", therefore the formatting for the cells is stored along with the text within the shared string item using the RichTextRun ( <r/> ) and RunProperties ( <rPr/> ) elements. To preserve the white space in between the text that is formatted differently, the space attribute of the text ( <t/> ) element is set equal to preserve . For more information about the rich text run and run properties elements, see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

### Text Class

The Text class represents the text ( <t/> ) element which represents the text content shown as part of a string.

### Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code takes a String and a SharedStringTablePart and verifies if the specified text exists in the shared string table. If the text does not exist, it is added as a shared string item to the shared string table.

For more information about how to use the SharedStringTable class to programmatically insert text into a cell, see How to: Insert text into a cell in a spreadsheet document.

C#

C#

static int InsertSharedStringItem(string text, SharedStringTablePart shareStringPart) { // If the part does not contain a SharedStringTable, create one. if (shareStringPart.SharedStringTable is null) { shareStringPart.SharedStringTable = new SharedStringTable(); }

int i = 0;

// Iterate through all the items in the SharedStringTable. If the text already exists, return its index. foreach (SharedStringItem item in shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.Elements<SharedStringItem>()) { if (item.InnerText == text) { return i; }

i++; }

// The text does not exist in the part. Create the SharedStringItem and return its index. shareStringPart.SharedStringTable.AppendChild(new SharedStringItem(new DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet.Text(text)));

return i; }

# Working with sheets

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK Worksheet, Chartsheet, and DialogSheet classes and how they relate to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document.

## Sheets in SpreadsheetML

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the sheet ( <sheet/> ) element.

Sheets are the central structures within a workbook, and are where the user does most of their spreadsheet work. The most common type of sheet is the worksheet, which is represented as a grid of cells. Worksheet cells can contain text, numbers, dates, and formulas. Cells can be formatted as well. Workbooks usually contain more than one sheet. To aid in the analysis of data and making informed decisions, spreadsheet applications often implement features and objects which help calculate, sort, filter, organize, and graphically display information. Since these features are often connected very tightly with the spreadsheet grid, these are also included in the sheet definition on disk.

Other types of sheets include chart sheets and dialog sheets.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## Open XML SDK Worksheet Class

The Open XML SDK Worksheet class represents the worksheet ( <worksheet/> ) element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for SpreadsheetML documents. Use the Worksheet class to manipulate individual <worksheet/> elements in a SpreadsheetML document.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the worksheet ( <worksheet/> ) element.

An instance of this part type contains all the data, formulas, and characteristics associated with a given worksheet.

A package shall contain exactly one Worksheet part per worksheet

Specifically, the id attribute on the sheet element shall reference the desired worksheet part.

The root element for a part of this content type shall be worksheet.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the minimum worksheet scenario.

The smallest possible (blank) sheet is as follows:

XML

<worksheet> <sheetData/> </worksheet>

The empty sheetData collection represents an empty grid; this element is required. As defined in the schema, some optional sheet property collections can appear before sheetData, and some can appear after. To simplify the logic required to insert a new sheetData collection into an existing (but empty) sheet, the sheetData collection is required, even when empty.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

A typical spreadsheet has at least one worksheet. The worksheet contains a table like structure for defining data, represented by the sheetData element. A sheet that contains data uses the worksheet element as the root element for defining worksheets. Inside a worksheet the data is split up into three distinct sections. The first section contains optional sheet properties. The second section contains the data, using the required sheetData element. The third section contains optional supporting features such as sheet protection and filter information. To define an empty worksheet you only have to use the worksheet and sheetData elements. The sheetData element can be empty.

To create new values for the worksheet you define rows inside the sheetData element. These rows contain cells, which contain values. The row element defines a new row. Normally the first row in the sheetData is the first row in the visible sheet. Inside the row you create new cells using the <c/> element. Values for cells can be provided by storing a <v/> element inside the cell. Usually the <v/> element contains the current value of the worksheet cell. If the value is a numeric value, it is stored directly in the <v/> element in the XML file. If the value is a string value, it is stored in a shared string table. For more information about using the shared string table to store string values, see Working with the shared string table.

The following table lists the common Open XML SDK classes used when working with the Worksheet class.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetML Element Open XML SDK Class

<sheetData/> SheetData

<row/> Row

<c/> Cell

<v/> CellValue

For more information about optional spreadsheet elements, such as sheet properties and supporting sheet features, see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

### SheetData Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the sheet data ( <sheetData/> ) element.

The cell table is the core structure of a worksheet. It consists of all the text, numbers, and formulas in the grid.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Row Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the row ( <row/> ) element.

The cells in the cell table are organized by row. Each row has an index (attribute r) so that empty rows need not be written out. Each row indicates the number of cells defined for it, as well as their relative position in the sheet. In this example, the first row of data is row 2.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Cell Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the cell ( <c/> ) element.

The cell itself is expressed by the c collection. Each cell indicates its location in the grid using A1-style reference notation. A cell can also indicate a style identifier (attribute s) and a data type (attribute t). The cell types include string, number, and Boolean. In order to optimize load/save operations, default data values are not written out.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### CellValue Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the cell value ( <v/> ) element.

Cells contain values, whether the values were directly entered (e.g., cell A2 in our example has the value External Link:) or are the result of a calculation (e.g., cell B3 in our example has the formula B2+1).

String values in a cell are not stored in the cell table unless they are the result of a calculation. Therefore, instead of seeing External Link as the content of the cell's v node, instead you see a zero-based index into the shared string table where that string is stored uniquely. This is done to optimize load/save performance and to reduce duplication of information. To determine whether the 0 in v is a number or an index to a string, the cell's data type must be examined. When the data type indicates string, then it is an index and not a numeric value.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

### Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code example creates a spreadsheet document with the specified file name and instantiates a Worksheet class, and then adds a row and adds a cell to the cell table at position A1. Then the value of the cell in A1 is set equal to the numeric value 100.

C#

C#

static void CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(string filepath) { // Use 'using' block to ensure proper disposal of the document using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Create(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook)) { // Add a WorkbookPart to the document.

WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart(); workbookPart.Workbook = new Workbook();

// Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart. WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>(); worksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());

// Add Sheets to the Workbook. Sheets sheets = workbookPart.Workbook.AppendChild(new Sheets());

// Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook. Sheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = workbookPart.GetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = "mySheet" }; sheets.Append(sheet);

// Get the sheetData cell table. SheetData sheetData = worksheetPart.Worksheet.GetFirstChild<SheetData>() ?? worksheetPart.Worksheet.AppendChild(new SheetData());

// Add a row to the cell table. Row row = new Row() { RowIndex = 1 }; sheetData.Append(row);

// In the new row, find the column location to insert a cell in A1. Cell? refCell = null;

foreach (Cell cell in row.Elements<Cell>()) { if (string.Compare(cell.CellReference?.Value, "A1", true) > 0) { refCell = cell; break; } }

// Add the cell to the cell table at A1. Cell newCell = new Cell() { CellReference = "A1" }; row.InsertBefore(newCell, refCell);

// Set the cell value to be a numeric value of 100. newCell.CellValue = new CellValue("100"); newCell.DataType = new EnumValue<CellValues>(CellValues.Number); } }

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK Table class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format SpreadsheetML schema. For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements that make up a SpreadsheetML document, see Structure of a SpreadsheetML document (Open XML SDK).

## Tables in SpreadsheetML

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the table ( <table/> ) element.

A table helps organize and provide structure to lists of information in a worksheet. Tables have clearly labeled columns, rows, and data regions. Tables make it easier for users to sort, analyze, format, manage, add, and delete information.

If a region of data is designated as a Table, then special behaviors can be applied which help the user perform useful actions. [Example: if the user types additional data in the row adjacent to the bottom of the table, the table can expand and automatically add that data to the data region of the table. Similarly, adding a column is as easy as typing a new column heading to the right or left of the current column headings. Filter and sort abilities can automatically be surfaced to the user via the drop down arrows. Special calculated columns can be created which summarize or calculate data in the table. These columns have the ability to expand and shrink according to size of the table, and maintain proper formula referencing. end example]

Tables can be created from data already present in the worksheet, from an external data query, or from mapping a collection of repeating XML elements to a worksheet range.

The sheet XML stores the numeric and textual data. The table XML records the various attributes for the particular table object.

A SpreadsheetML table is a logical construct that specifies that a range of data belongs to a single dataset. SpreadsheetML already uses a table-like model for specifying values in rows and columns, but you can also label a subset of the sheet as a table and give it certain properties that are useful for analysis. A table in SpreadsheetML allows you to analyze data in new ways, such as by using filtering, formatting and binding of data.

Like other constructs in SpreadsheetML, a table in a worksheet is stored in a separate part inside the package. The table part does not contain any table data. The data is

maintained in the worksheet cells. For more information about data is stored in the worksheet, see Working with sheets.

The following table lists the common Open XML SDK classes used when working with the Table class.

ﾉ Expand table

SpreadsheetML Element Open XML SDK Class

## Open XML SDK Table Class

The Open XML SDK Table class represents the table ( <table/> ) element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for SpreadsheetML documents. Use the Table class to manipulate individual <table/> elements in a SpreadsheetML document.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the table ( <table/> ) element.

An instance of this part type contains a description of a single table and its autofilter information. (The data for the table is stored in the corresponding Worksheet part.)

The root element for a part of this content type shall be table.

The table part contains the definition of a single table. When there are multiple tables on a worksheet there are multiple table parts. The root element for this part is the table. At a minimum, the table only needs information about the table columns that make up the table. However, to enable autofiltering you must define at least one autofilter, which can be empty. If you do not define any autofilter, autofiltering will be disabled when the document is opened in Excel.

The table element has several attributes used to identify the table and the data range it covers. The id and name attributes must be unique across all table parts. The displayName attribute must be unique across all table parts and unique across all defined names in the workbook. The name attribute is used by the object model in Excel. The displayName attribute is used by references in formulas. The ref attribute is used to identify the cell range that the table covers. This includes not only the table data, but also the table header containing column names. For more information about table attributes, see the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

### Table Column Class

To add columns to your table you add new tableColumn elements to the tableColumns collection. The collection has a count attribute that tracks the number of columns.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the TableColumn ( <tableColumn/> ) element.

An element representing a single column for this table.

### Auto Filter Class

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the AutoFilter ( <autoFilter/> ) element.

AutoFilter temporarily hides rows based on filter criteria, which is applied column by column to a table of data in the worksheet. This collection expresses AutoFilter settings.

Example: This example expresses a filter indicating to 'show only values greater than 0.5'. The filter is being applied to the range B3:E8, and the criteria is being applied to values in the column whose colId='1' (zero based column numbering, from left to right). Therefore any rows must be hidden if the value in that particular column is less than or equal to 0.5.

XML

<autoFilter ref="B3:E8"> <filterColumn colId="1"> <customFilters> <customFilter operator="greaterThan" val="0.5"/> </customFilters> </filterColumn> </autoFilter>

### SpreadsheetML Example

This example shows the XML for a file that contains one table on Sheet1. The table contains three columns and three rows, plus a column header.

The following XML defines the worksheet and is contained in the "sheet1.xml" file. The worksheet XML file contains the actual data displayed in the table, and contains the tablePart element that references the "table1.xml" file, which contains the table definition.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <worksheet xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships " xmlns:mc="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006" mc:Ignorable="x14ac" xmlns:x14ac="https://schemas.microsoft.com/office/spreadsheetml/2009/9/ac"> <dimension ref="A1:C4"/> <sheetViews> <sheetView tabSelected="1" workbookViewId="0"> <selection sqref="A1:C4"/> </sheetView> </sheetViews> <sheetFormatPr defaultRowHeight="15" x14ac:dyDescent="0.25"/> <cols> <col min="1" max="3" width="11" customWidth="1"/> </cols> <sheetData> <row r="1" spans="1:3" x14ac:dyDescent="0.25"> <c r="A1" t="s"> <v>0</v> </c> <c r="B1" t="s"> <v>1</v> </c> <c r="C1" t="s"> <v>2</v> </c> </row> <row r="2" spans="1:3" x14ac:dyDescent="0.25"> <c r="A2"> <v>1</v> </c> <c r="B2"> <v>2</v> </c> <c r="C2"> <v>3</v> </c> </row> <row r="3" spans="1:3" x14ac:dyDescent="0.25"> <c r="A3"> <v>4</v> </c> <c r="B3"> <v>5</v> </c> <c r="C3"> <v>6</v> </c> </row> <row r="4" spans="1:3" x14ac:dyDescent="0.25">

The following XML defines the table and is contained in the "table1.xml" file. The table XML file defines how the range of the table and how the table looks, and defines any autofilters for the table.

XML

Article • 01/12/2024

This topic discusses the basic structure of a WordprocessingML document and reviews important Open XML SDK classes that are used most often to create WordprocessingML documents.

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the <document> and <body> elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as <p> , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more <r> elements. The <r> stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more <t> elements. The <t> element contains a range of text.

## Important WordprocessingML Parts

The Open XML SDK API provides strongly-typed classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXML.WordprocessingML namespace that correspond to WordprocessingML elements.

The following table lists some important WordprocessingML elements, the WordprocessingML document package part that the element corresponds to (where applicable) and the managed class that represents the element in the Open XML SDK API.

ﾉ Expand table

Package Part WordprocessingMLOpen XML SDKDescription ElementClass

Maindocument Document The root element for the main Documentdocument part.

Comments comments Comments The root element for the comments part.

Documentsettings Settings The root element for the Settingsdocument settings part.

Endnotes endnotes Endnotes The root element for the endnotes part.

Footnotes footnotes Footnotes The root element for the footnotes part.

GlossaryglossaryDocument GlossaryDocument The root element for the Documentglossary document part.

Header hdr Header The root element for the header part.

Stylestyles Styles The root element for a Style DefinitionsDefinitions part.

## Minimum Document Scenario

A WordprocessingML document is organized around the concept of stories. A story is a region of content in a WordprocessingML document. WordprocessingML stories include:

comment

endnote

footer

footnote

frame, glossary document

header

main story

subdocument

text box

Not all stories must be present in a valid WordprocessingML document. The simplest, valid WordprocessingML document only requires a single story—the main document story. In WordprocessingML, the main document story is represented by the main document part. At a minimum, to create a valid WordprocessingML document using code, add a main document part to the document.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 introduces the WordprocessingML elements required in the main document part in order to complete the minimum document scenario.

The main document story of the simplest WordprocessingML document consists of the following XML elements:

document — The root element for a WordprocessingML's main document part, which defines the main document story.

body — The container for the collection of block-level structures that comprise the main story.

p — A paragraph.

r — A run.

t — A range of text.

### Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code uses the Open XML SDK to create a simple WordprocessingML document that contains the text passed in as the second parameter

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing;

static void CreateWordDoc(string filepath, string msg) { using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Create(filepath, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.WordprocessingDocumentType.Document)) { // Add a main document part. MainDocumentPart mainPart = doc.AddMainDocumentPart();

// Create the document structure and add some text. mainPart.Document = new Document(); Body body = mainPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body()); Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run());

// String msg contains the text from the msg parameter" run.AppendChild(new Text(msg)); } }

### Generated WordprocessingML

After you run the Open XML SDK code in the previous section to generate a document, you can explore the contents of the .zip package to view the WordprocessingML XML code. To view the .zip package, rename the extension on the minimum document from .docx to .zip. The .zip package contains the parts that make up the document. In this case, since the code created a minimal WordprocessingML document, there is only a single part—the main document part.The following figure shows the structure under the word folder of the .zip package for a minimum document that contains a single line of text.Art placeholderThe document.xml file corresponds to the WordprocessingML main document part and it is this part that contains the content of the main body of the document. The following XML code is generated in the document.xml file when you run the Open XML SDK code in the previous section.

XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>The text passed as the second parameter goes here</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

## Typical Document Scenario

A typical document will not be a blank, minimum document. A typical document might contain comments, headers, footers, footnotes, and endnotes, for example. Each of these additional parts is contained within the zip package of the wordprocessing document.

The following figure shows many of the parts that you would find in a typical document.

This topic shows how to use the Open XML SDK for Office to accept all revisions in a word processing document programmatically.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly- typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document , body , p , r , and t elements.

## ParagraphPropertiesChange Element

When you accept a revision mark, you change the properties of a paragraph either by deleting existing text or inserting new text. In the following sections, you read about three elements that are used in the code to change the paragraph contents, mainly, <w: pPrChange> (Revision Information for Paragraph Properties), <w:del> (Deleted Paragraph), and <w:ins> (Inserted Table Row) elements.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the ParagraphPropertiesChange element ( pPrChange ).

### *pPrChange (Revision Information for Paragraph Properties)

This element specifies the details about a single revision to a set of paragraph properties in a WordprocessingML document.

This element stores this revision as follows:

The child element of this element contains the complete set of paragraph properties which were applied to this paragraph before this revision.

The attributes of this element contain information about when this revision took place (in other words, when these properties became a "former" set of paragraph properties).

Consider a paragraph in a WordprocessingML document which is centered, and this change in the paragraph properties is tracked as a revision. This revision would be specified using the following WordprocessingML markup.

XML

<w:pPr> <w:jc w:val="center"/>

<w:pPrChange w:id="0" w:date="01-01-2006T12:00:00" w:author="Samantha Smith"> <w:pPr/> </w:pPrChange> </w:pPr>

The element specifies that there was a revision to the paragraph properties at 01-01-2006 by Samantha Smith, and the previous set of paragraph properties on the paragraph was the null set (in other words, no paragraph properties explicitly present under the element). pPr

pPrChange

## Deleted Element

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Deleted element ( del ).

### del (Deleted Paragraph)

This element specifies that the paragraph mark delimiting the end of a paragraph within a WordprocessingML document shall be treated as deleted (in other words, the contents of this paragraph are no longer delimited by this paragraph mark, and are combined with the following paragraph, but those contents shall not automatically be marked as deleted) as part of a tracked revision.

Consider a document consisting of two paragraphs (with each paragraph delimited by a pilcrow ¶):

If the physical character delimiting the end of the first paragraph is deleted and this change is tracked as a revision, the following will result:

This revision is represented using the following WordprocessingML:

XML

<w:p> <w:pPr> <w:rPr> <w:del w:id="0" … /> </w:rPr> </w:pPr> <w:r> <w:t>This is paragraph one.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>This is paragraph two.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p>

The del element on the run properties for the first paragraph mark specifies that this paragraph mark was deleted, and this deletion was tracked as a revision.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## The Inserted Element

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Inserted element ( ins ).

### ins (Inserted Table Row)

This element specifies that the parent table row shall be treated as an inserted row whose insertion has been tracked as a revision. This setting shall not imply any revision state about the table cells in this row or their contents (which must be revision marked independently), and shall only affect the table row itself.

Consider a two row by two column table in which the second row has been marked as inserted using a revision. This requirement would be specified using the following WordprocessingML:

XML

<w:tbl> <w:tr> <w:tc> <w:p/> </w:tc> <w:tc> <w:p/> </w:tc>

</w:tr> <w:tr> <w:trPr> <w:ins w:id="0" … /> </w:trPr> <w:tc> <w:p/> </w:tc> <w:tc> <w:p/> </w:tc> </w:tr> </w:tbl>

The ins element on the table row properties for the second table row specifies that this row was inserted, and this insertion was tracked as a revision.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## Move From Element

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Move From element ( moveFrom ).

### moveFrom (Move Source Paragraph)

This element indicates that the parent paragraph has been relocated from this position and marked as a revision. This does not affect the revision status of the paragraph's content and pertains solely to the paragraph's existence as a distinct entity.

Consider a WordprocessingML document where a paragraph of text is moved down within the document. This relocated paragraph would be represented using the following WordprocessingML markup:

XML

<w:moveFromRangeStart w:id="0" w:name="aMove"/> <w:p> <w:pPr> <w:rPr> <w:moveFrom w:id="1" … /> </w:rPr> </w:pPr> …</w:p> </w:moveFromRangeEnd w:id="0"/>

### moveFromRangeStart (Move Source Location Container -

### Start)

This element marks the beginning of a region where the move source contents are part of a single named move. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Move From Range Start element ( moveFromRangeStart ).

### moveFromRangeEnd (Move Source Location Container - End)

This element marks the end of a region where the move source contents are part of a single named move. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Move From Range End element ( moveFromRangeEnd ).

## The Moved To Element

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the MoveTo element ( moveTo ).

### moveTo (Move Destination Paragraph)

This element specifies that the parent paragraph has been moved to this location and tracked as a revision. This does not imply anything about the revision state of the contents of the paragraph, and applies only to the existence of the paragraph as its own unique paragraph.

Consider a WordprocessingML document in which a paragraph of text is moved down in the document. This moved paragraph would be represented using the following WordprocessingML markup:

XML

<w:moveToRangeStart w:id="0" w:name="aMove"/> <w:p> <w:pPr> <w:rPr> <w:moveTo w:id="1" … /> </w:rPr> </w:pPr> …</w:p> </w:moveToRangeEnd w:id="0"/>

### moveToRangeStart (Move Destination Location Container -

### Start)

This element specifies the start of the region whose move destination contents are part of a single named move. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Move To Range Start element ( moveToRangeStart ).

### moveToRangeEnd (Move Destination Location Container -

### End)

This element specifies the end of a region whose move destination contents are part of a single named move. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Move To Range End element ( moveToRangeEnd ).

## Sample Code

The following code example shows how to accept the entire revisions in a word processing document.

After you have run the program, open the word processing document to make sure that all revision marks have been accepted.

C#

C#

AcceptAllRevisions(args[0], args[1]);

static void AcceptAllRevisions(string fileName, string authorName) { using (WordprocessingDocument wdDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (wdDoc.MainDocumentPart is null || wdDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

Body body = wdDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body;

// Handle the insertions. HandleInsertions(body, authorName);

// Handle move from elements. RemoveElements(body.Descendants<Paragraph>() .Where(p => p.Descendants<MoveFrom>() .Any(m => m.Author?.Value == authorName))); RemoveElements(body.Descendants<MoveFromRangeEnd>());

foreach (var insertion in insertions) { // Promote new content to the same level as the node and then delete the node foreach (var run in insertion.Elements<Run>()) {

if (run == insertion.FirstChild) { insertion.InsertAfterSelf(new Run(run.OuterXml));

} else { OpenXmlElement nextSibling = insertion.NextSibling()!; nextSibling.InsertAfterSelf(new Run(run.OuterXml)); } }

// Remove specific attributes and the insertion element itself insertion.RemoveAttribute("rsidR", "https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"); insertion.RemoveAttribute("rsidRPr", "https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"); insertion.Remove(); } }

// Method to handle move-to elements in the document body static void HandleMoveToElements(Body body, string authorName) { // Collect all move-to elements by the specified author var paragraphs = body.Descendants<Paragraph>() .Where(p => p.Descendants<MoveFrom>() .Any(m => m.Author?.Value == authorName)); var moveToRun = body.Descendants<MoveToRun>(); var moveToRangeEnd = body.Descendants<MoveToRangeEnd>();

List<OpenXmlElement> moveToElements = [.. paragraphs, .. moveToRun, .. moveToRangeEnd];

foreach (var toElement in moveToElements) { // Promote new content to the same level as the node and then delete the node foreach (var run in toElement.Elements<Run>()) { toElement.InsertBeforeSelf(new Run(run.OuterXml)); } // Remove the move-to element itself toElement.Remove(); } }

# Add tables to word processing

# documents

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically add a table to a word processing document. It contains an example AddTable method to illustrate this task.

## AddTable method

You can use the AddTable method to add a simple table to a word processing document. The AddTable method accepts two parameters, indicating the following:

The name of the document to modify (string).

A two-dimensional array of strings to insert into the document as a table.

C#

C#

static void AddTable(string fileName, string[,] data)

## Call the AddTable method

The AddTable method modifies the document you specify, adding a table that contains the information in the two-dimensional array that you provide. To call the method, pass both of the parameter values, as shown in the following code.

C#

C#

string fileName = args[0];

AddTable(fileName, new string[,] { { "Hawaii", "HI" }, { "California", "CA" }, { "New York", "NY" },

{ "Massachusetts", "MA" } });

## How the code works

The following code starts by opening the document, using the Open method and indicating that the document should be open for read/write access (the final true parameter value). Next the code retrieves a reference to the root element of the main document part, using the Document property of theMainDocumentPart of the word processing document.

C#

C#

using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (document.MainDocumentPart is null || document.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

var doc = document.MainDocumentPart.Document;

## Create the table object and set its properties

Before you can insert a table into a document, you must create the Table object and set its properties. To set a table's properties, you create and supply values for a TableProperties object. The TableProperties class provides many table-oriented properties, like Shading, TableBorders, TableCaption, TableCellProperties, TableJustification, and more. The sample method includes the following code.

C#

C#

Table table = new();

TableProperties props = new( new TableBorders(

new TopBorder { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Single), Size = 12 }, new BottomBorder { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Single), Size = 12 }, new LeftBorder { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Single), Size = 12 }, new RightBorder { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Single), Size = 12 }, new InsideHorizontalBorder { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Single), Size = 12 }, new InsideVerticalBorder { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Single), Size = 12 }));

table.AppendChild<TableProperties>(props);

The constructor for the TableProperties class allows you to specify as many child elements as you like (much like the XElement constructor). In this case, the code creates TopBorder, BottomBorder, LeftBorder, RightBorder, InsideHorizontalBorder, and InsideVerticalBorder child elements, each describing one of the border elements for the table. For each element, the code sets the Val and Size properties as part of calling the constructor. Setting the size is simple, but setting the Val property requires a bit more effort: this property, for this particular object, represents the border style, and you must set it to an enumerated value. To do that, create an instance of the EnumValue<T> generic type, passing the specific border type (BorderValues) as a parameter to the constructor. Once the code has set all the table border value it needs to set, it calls the AppendChild method of the table, indicating that the generic type is TableProperties i.e., it is appending an instance of the TableProperties class, using the variable props as the value.

## Fill the table with data

Given that table and its properties, now it is time to fill the table with data. The sample procedure iterates first through all the rows of data in the array of strings that you specified, creating a new TableRow instance for each row of data. The following code shows how you create and append the row to the table. Then for each column, the code creates a new TableCell object, fills it with data, and appends it to the row.

Next, the code does the following:

Creates a new Text object that contains a value from the array of strings. Passes the Text object to the constructor for a new Run object. Passes the Run object to the constructor for a new Paragraph object. Passes the Paragraph object to the Append method of the cell.

The code then appends a new TableCellProperties object to the cell. This TableCellProperties object, like the TableProperties object you already saw, can accept as many objects in its constructor as you care to supply. In this case, the code passes only a new TableCellWidth object, with its Type property set to TableWidthUnitValues (so that the table automatically sizes the width of each column).

C#

C#

for (var i = 0; i < data.GetUpperBound(0); i++) { var tr = new TableRow(); for (var j = 0; j < data.GetUpperBound(1); j++) { var tc = new TableCell(); tc.Append(new Paragraph(new Run(new Text(data[i, j]))));

// Assume you want columns that are automatically sized. tc.Append(new TableCellProperties( new TableCellWidth { Type = TableWidthUnitValues.Auto }));

tr.Append(tc); } table.Append(tr); }

## Finish up

The following code concludes by appending the table to the body of the document, and then saving the document.

C#

C#

doc.Body.Append(table);

## Sample Code

The following is the complete AddTable code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

# Apply a style to a paragraph in a word

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically apply a style to a paragraph within a word processing document. It contains an example ApplyStyleToParagraph method to illustrate this task, plus several supplemental example methods to check whether a style exists, add a new style, and add the styles part.

## ApplyStyleToParagraph method

The ApplyStyleToParagraph example method can be used to apply a style to a paragraph. You must first obtain a reference to the document as well as a reference to the paragraph that you want to style. The method accepts four parameters that indicate: the path to the word processing document to open, the styleid of the style to be applied, the name of the style to be applied, and the reference to the paragraph to which to apply the style.

C#

C#

static void ApplyStyleToParagraph(WordprocessingDocument doc, string styleid, string stylename, Paragraph p)

The following sections in this topic explain the implementation of this method and the supporting code, as well as how to call it. The complete sample code listing can be found in the Sample Code section at the end of this topic.

## Get a WordprocessingDocument object

The Sample Code section also shows the code required to set up for calling the sample method. To use the method to apply a style to a paragraph in a document, you first need a reference to the open document. In the Open XML SDK, the WordprocessingDocument class represents a Word document package. To open and work with a Word document, create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class from the document. After you create the instance, use it to obtain access to the main

document part that contains the text of the document. The content in the main document part is represented in the package as XML using WordprocessingML markup.

To create the class instance, call one of the overloads of the Open method. The following sample code shows how to use the

DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.WordprocessingDocument.Open(String, Boolean) overload. The first parameter takes a string that represents the full path to the document to open. The second parameter takes a value of true or false and represents whether to open the file for editing. In this example the parameter is true to enable read/write access to the file.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(args[0], true))

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Get the paragraph to style

After opening the file, the sample code retrieves a reference to the first paragraph. Because a typical word processing document body contains many types of elements, the code filters the descendants in the body of the document to those of type Paragraph . The ElementAtOrDefault method is then employed to retrieve a reference to the paragraph. Because the elements are indexed starting at zero, you pass a zero to retrieve the reference to the first paragraph, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// Get the first paragraph in the document. Paragraph? paragraph = doc?.MainDocumentPart?.Document?.Body?.Descendants<Paragraph> ().ElementAtOrDefault(0);

The reference to the found paragraph is stored in a variable named paragraph. If a paragraph is not found at the specified index, the ElementAtOrDefault method returns null as the default value. This provides an opportunity to test for null and throw an error with an appropriate error message.

Once you have the references to the document and the paragraph, you can call the ApplyStyleToParagraph example method to do the remaining work. To call the method, you pass the reference to the document as the first parameter, the styleid of the style to apply as the second parameter, the name of the style as the third parameter, and the reference to the paragraph to which to apply the style, as the fourth parameter.

## Add the paragraph properties element

The first step of the example method is to ensure that the paragraph has a paragraph properties element. The paragraph properties element is a child element of the paragraph and includes a set of properties that allow you to specify the formatting for the paragraph.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the pPr (paragraph properties) element used for specifying the formatting of a paragraph. Note that section numbers preceded by § are from the ISO specification.

Within the paragraph, all rich formatting at the paragraph level is stored within the pPr element (§17.3.1.25; §17.3.1.26). [Note: Some examples of paragraph properties are alignment, border, hyphenation override, indentation, line spacing, shading, text direction, and widow/orphan control.

Among the properties is the pStyle element to specify the style to apply to the paragraph. For example, the following sample markup shows a pStyle element that specifies the "OverdueAmount" style.

XML

<w:p xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:pPr> <w:pStyle w:val="OverdueAmount" /> </w:pPr> ... </w:p>

In the Open XML SDK, the pPr element is represented by the ParagraphProperties class. The code determines if the element exists, and creates a new instance of the

ParagraphProperties class if it does not. The pPr element is a child of the p (paragraph) element; consequently, the PrependChild method is used to add the instance, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// If the paragraph has no ParagraphProperties object, create one. if (p.Elements<ParagraphProperties>().Count() == 0) { p.PrependChild<ParagraphProperties>(new ParagraphProperties()); }

// Get the paragraph properties element of the paragraph. ParagraphProperties pPr = p.Elements<ParagraphProperties>().First();

## Add the Styles part

With the paragraph found and the paragraph properties element present, now ensure that the prerequisites are in place for applying the style. Styles in WordprocessingML are stored in their own unique part. Even though it is typically true that the part as well as a set of base styles are created automatically when you create the document by using an application like Microsoft Word, the styles part is not required for a document to be considered valid. If you create the document programmatically using the Open XML SDK, the styles part is not created automatically; you must explicitly create it. Consequently, the following code verifies that the styles part exists, and creates it if it does not.

C#

C#

// Get the Styles part for this document. StyleDefinitionsPart? part = doc.MainDocumentPart?.StyleDefinitionsPart;

// If the Styles part does not exist, add it and then add the style. if (part is null) { part = AddStylesPartToPackage(doc);

The AddStylesPartToPackage example method does the work of adding the styles part. It creates a part of the StyleDefinitionsPart type, adding it as a child to the main document part. The code then appends the Styles root element, which is the parent element that contains all of the styles. The Styles element is represented by the Styles class in the Open XML SDK. Finally, the code saves the part.

C#

C#

// Add a StylesDefinitionsPart to the document. Returns a reference to it. static StyleDefinitionsPart AddStylesPartToPackage(WordprocessingDocument doc) { MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = doc.MainDocumentPart ?? doc.AddMainDocumentPart(); StyleDefinitionsPart part = mainDocumentPart.AddNewPart<StyleDefinitionsPart>(); Styles root = new Styles();

return part; }

## Verify that the style exists

Applying a style that does not exist to a paragraph has no effect; there is no exception generated and no formatting changes occur. The example code verifies the style exists prior to attempting to apply the style. Styles are stored in the styles part, therefore if the styles part does not exist, the style itself cannot exist.

If the styles part exists, the code verifies a matching style by calling the IsStyleIdInDocument example method and passing the document and the styleid. If no match is found on styleid, the code then tries to lookup the styleid by calling the GetStyleIdFromStyleName example method and passing it the style name.

If the style does not exist, either because the styles part did not exist, or because the styles part exists, but the style does not, the code calls the AddNewStyle example method to add the style.

C#

C#

// Get the Styles part for this document. StyleDefinitionsPart? part = doc.MainDocumentPart?.StyleDefinitionsPart;

// If the Styles part does not exist, add it and then add the style. if (part is null) { part = AddStylesPartToPackage(doc); AddNewStyle(part, styleid, stylename); } else { // If the style is not in the document, add it. if (IsStyleIdInDocument(doc, styleid) != true) { // No match on styleid, so let's try style name. string? styleidFromName = GetStyleIdFromStyleName(doc, stylename);

if (styleidFromName is null) { AddNewStyle(part, styleid, stylename); } else styleid = styleidFromName; } }

Within the IsStyleInDocument example method, the work begins with retrieving the Styles element through the Styles property of the StyleDefinitionsPart of the main document part, and then determining whether any styles exist as children of that element. All style elements are stored as children of the styles element.

If styles do exist, the code looks for a match on the styleid. The styleid is an attribute of the style that is used in many places in the document to refer to the style, and can be thought of as its primary identifier. Typically you use the styleid to identify a style in code. The FirstOrDefault method defaults to null if no match is found, so the code verifies for null to see whether a style was matched, as shown in the following excerpt.

C#

C#

// Return true if the style id is in the document, false otherwise. static bool IsStyleIdInDocument(WordprocessingDocument doc, string styleid) { // Get access to the Styles element for this document.

Styles? s = doc.MainDocumentPart?.StyleDefinitionsPart?.Styles;

if (s is null) { return false; }

// Check that there are styles and how many. int n = s.Elements<Style>().Count();

if (n == 0) { return false; }

// Look for a match on styleid. Style? style = s.Elements<Style>() .Where(st => (st.StyleId is not null && st.StyleId == styleid) && (st.Type is not null && st.Type == StyleValues.Paragraph)) .FirstOrDefault(); if (style is null) { return false; }

return true; }

When the style cannot be found based on the styleid, the code attempts to find a match based on the style name instead. The GetStyleIdFromStyleName example method does this work, looking for a match on style name and returning the styleid for the matching element if found, or null if not.

## Add the style to the styles part

The AddNewStyle example method takes three parameters. The first parameter takes a reference to the styles part. The second parameter takes the styleid of the style, and the third parameter takes the style name. The AddNewStyle code creates the named style definition within the specified part.

To create the style, the code instantiates the Style class and sets certain properties, such as the Type of style (paragraph) and StyleId. As mentioned above, the styleid is used by the document to refer to the style, and can be thought of as its primary identifier. Typically you use the styleid to identify a style in code. A style can also have a separate user friendly style name to be shown in the user interface. Often the style name therefore appears in proper case and with spacing (for example, Heading 1), while the

styleid is more succinct (for example, heading1) and intended for internal use. In the following sample code, the styleid and style name take their values from the styleid and stylename parameters.

The next step is to specify a few additional properties, such as the style upon which the new style is based, and the style to be automatically applied to the next paragraph. The code specifies both of these as the "Normal" style. Be aware that the value to specify here is the styleid for the normal style. The code appends these properties as children of the style element.

Once the code has finished instantiating the style and setting up the basic properties, now work on the style formatting. Style formatting is performed in the paragraph properties ( pPr ) and run properties ( rPr ) elements. To set the font and color characteristics for the runs in a paragraph, you use the run properties.

To create the rPr element with the appropriate child elements, the code creates an instance of the StyleRunProperties class and then appends instances of the appropriate property classes. For this code example, the style specifies the Lucida Console font, a point size of 12, rendered in bold and italic, using the Accent2 color from the document theme part. The point size is specified in half-points, so a value of 24 is equivalent to 12 point.

When the style definition is complete, the code appends the style to the styles element in the styles part, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// Create a new style with the specified styleid and stylename and add it to the specified // style definitions part. static void AddNewStyle(StyleDefinitionsPart styleDefinitionsPart, string styleid, string stylename) { // Get access to the root element of the styles part. styleDefinitionsPart.Styles ??= new Styles(); Styles styles = styleDefinitionsPart.Styles;

// Create a new paragraph style and specify some of the properties. Style style = new Style() { Type = StyleValues.Paragraph, StyleId = styleid, CustomStyle = true }; StyleName styleName1 = new StyleName() { Val = stylename };

BasedOn basedOn1 = new BasedOn() { Val = "Normal" }; NextParagraphStyle nextParagraphStyle1 = new NextParagraphStyle() { Val = "Normal" }; style.Append(styleName1); style.Append(basedOn1); style.Append(nextParagraphStyle1);

// Create the StyleRunProperties object and specify some of the run properties. StyleRunProperties styleRunProperties1 = new StyleRunProperties(); Bold bold1 = new Bold(); Color color1 = new Color() { ThemeColor = ThemeColorValues.Accent2 }; RunFonts font1 = new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Lucida Console" }; Italic italic1 = new Italic(); // Specify a 12 point size. FontSize fontSize1 = new FontSize() { Val = "24" }; styleRunProperties1.Append(bold1); styleRunProperties1.Append(color1); styleRunProperties1.Append(font1); styleRunProperties1.Append(fontSize1); styleRunProperties1.Append(italic1);

// Add the run properties to the style. style.Append(styleRunProperties1);

// Add the style to the styles part. styles.Append(style); }

## Sample Code

# Change the print orientation of a word

# processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically set the print orientation of a Microsoft Word document. It contains an example SetPrintOrientation method to illustrate this task.

## SetPrintOrientation Method

You can use the SetPrintOrientation method to change the print orientation of a word processing document. The method accepts two parameters that indicate the name of the document to modify (string) and the new print orientation (PageOrientationValues).

The following code shows the SetPrintOrientation method.

C#

static void SetPrintOrientation(string fileName, string orientation)

For each section in the document, if the new orientation differs from the section's current print orientation, the code modifies the print orientation for the section. In addition, the code must manually update the width, height, and margins for each section.

## Calling the Sample SetPrintOrientation Method

To call the sample SetPrintOrientation method, pass a string that contains the name of the file to convert and the string "landscape" or "portrait" depending on which orientation you want. The following code shows an example method call.

C#

SetPrintOrientation(args[0], args[1]);

## How the Code Works

The following code first determines which orientation to apply and then opens the document by using the Open method and sets the isEditable parameter to true to indicate that the document should be read/write. The code retrieves a reference to the main document part, and then uses that reference to retrieve a collection of all of the descendants of type SectionProperties within the content of the document. Later code will use this collection to set the orientation for each section in turn.

C#

PageOrientationValues newOrientation = orientation.ToLower() switch { "landscape" => PageOrientationValues.Landscape, "portrait" => PageOrientationValues.Portrait, _ => throw new System.ArgumentException("Invalid argument: " + orientation) };

using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (document?.MainDocumentPart?.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

Body docBody = document.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body;

IEnumerable<SectionProperties> sections = docBody.ChildElements.OfType<SectionProperties>();

if (sections.Count() == 0) { docBody.AddChild(new SectionProperties());

sections = docBody.ChildElements.OfType<SectionProperties>(); }

## Iterating Through All the Sections

The next block of code iterates through all the sections in the collection of SectionProperties elements. For each section, the code initializes a variable that tracks whether the page orientation for the section was changed so the code can update the page size and margins. (If the new orientation matches the original orientation, the code will not update the page.) The code continues by retrieving a reference to the first PageSize descendant of the SectionProperties element. If the reference is not null, the code updates the orientation as required.

C#

foreach (SectionProperties sectPr in sections) { bool pageOrientationChanged = false;

PageSize pgSz = sectPr.ChildElements.OfType<PageSize> ().FirstOrDefault() ?? sectPr.AppendChild(new PageSize() { Width = 12240, Height = 15840 });

## Setting the Orientation for the Section

The next block of code first checks whether the Orient property of the PageSize element exists. As with many properties of Open XML elements, the property or attribute might not exist yet. In that case, retrieving the property returns a null reference. By default, if the property does not exist, and the new orientation is Portrait, the code will not update the page. If the Orient property already exists, and its value differs from the new orientation value supplied as a parameter to the method, the code sets the Value property of the Orient property, and sets the pageOrientationChanged flag. (The code uses the pageOrientationChanged flag to determine whether it must update the page size and margins.)

７ Note

If the code must create the Orient property, it must also create the value to store in the property, as a new EnumValue<T> instance, supplying the new orientation in the EnumValue constructor.

C#

if (pgSz.Orient is null) { // Need to create the attribute. You do not need to // create the Orient property if the property does not // already exist, and you are setting it to Portrait. // That is the default value. if (newOrientation != PageOrientationValues.Portrait) { pageOrientationChanged = true; pgSz.Orient = new EnumValue<PageOrientationValues> (newOrientation); } } else { // The Orient property exists, but its value // is different than the new value. if (pgSz.Orient.Value != newOrientation) { pgSz.Orient.Value = newOrientation; pageOrientationChanged = true; }

## Updating the Page Size

At this point in the code, the page orientation may have changed. If so, the code must complete two more tasks. It must update the page size, and update the page margins for the section. The first task is easy—the following code just swaps the page height and width, storing the values in the PageSize element.

C#

if (pageOrientationChanged) { // Changing the orientation is not enough. You must also // change the page size. var width = pgSz.Width; var height = pgSz.Height; pgSz.Width = height; pgSz.Height = width;

## Updating the Margins

The next step in the sample procedure handles margins for the section. If the page orientation has changed, the code must rotate the margins to match. To do so, the code retrieves a reference to the PageMargin element for the section. If the element exists, the code rotates the margins. Note that the code rotates the margins by 90 degrees— some printers rotate the margins by 270 degrees instead and you could modify the code to take that into account. Also be aware that the Top and Bottom properties of the PageMargin object are signed values, and the Left and Right properties are unsigned values. The code must convert between the two types of values as it rotates the margin settings, as shown in the following code.

C#

PageMargin? pgMar = sectPr.Descendants<PageMargin>().FirstOrDefault();

if (pgMar is not null) { // Rotate margins. Printer settings control how far you // rotate when switching to landscape mode. Not having those // settings, this code rotates 90 degrees. You could easily // modify this behavior, or make it a parameter for the // procedure. if (pgMar.Top is null || pgMar.Bottom is null || pgMar.Left is null || pgMar.Right is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("One or more of the PageMargin elements is null."); }

var top = pgMar.Top.Value; var bottom = pgMar.Bottom.Value; var left = pgMar.Left.Value; var right = pgMar.Right.Value;

pgMar.Top = new Int32Value((int)left); pgMar.Bottom = new Int32Value((int)right); pgMar.Left = new UInt32Value((uint)System.Math.Max(0, bottom)); pgMar.Right = new UInt32Value((uint)System.Math.Max(0, top)); }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete SetPrintOrientation code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static void SetPrintOrientation(string fileName, string orientation) { PageOrientationValues newOrientation = orientation.ToLower() switch { "landscape" => PageOrientationValues.Landscape, "portrait" => PageOrientationValues.Portrait, _ => throw new System.ArgumentException("Invalid argument: " + orientation) };

using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (document?.MainDocumentPart?.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

Body docBody = document.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body;

IEnumerable<SectionProperties> sections = docBody.ChildElements.OfType<SectionProperties>();

if (sections.Count() == 0) { docBody.AddChild(new SectionProperties());

sections = docBody.ChildElements.OfType<SectionProperties> (); }

foreach (SectionProperties sectPr in sections) { bool pageOrientationChanged = false;

PageSize pgSz = sectPr.ChildElements.OfType<PageSize> ().FirstOrDefault() ?? sectPr.AppendChild(new PageSize() { Width = 12240, Height = 15840 });

// No Orient property? Create it now. Otherwise, just // set its value. Assume that the default orientation is Portrait. if (pgSz.Orient is null) { // Need to create the attribute. You do not need to // create the Orient property if the property does not // already exist, and you are setting it to Portrait. // That is the default value. if (newOrientation != PageOrientationValues.Portrait) { pageOrientationChanged = true;

pgSz.Orient = new EnumValue<PageOrientationValues> (newOrientation); } } else { // The Orient property exists, but its value // is different than the new value. if (pgSz.Orient.Value != newOrientation) { pgSz.Orient.Value = newOrientation; pageOrientationChanged = true; }

if (pageOrientationChanged) { // Changing the orientation is not enough. You must also // change the page size. var width = pgSz.Width; var height = pgSz.Height; pgSz.Width = height; pgSz.Height = width;

PageMargin? pgMar = sectPr.Descendants<PageMargin> ().FirstOrDefault();

if (pgMar is not null) { // Rotate margins. Printer settings control how far you // rotate when switching to landscape mode. Not having those // settings, this code rotates 90 degrees. You could easily // modify this behavior, or make it a parameter for the // procedure. if (pgMar.Top is null || pgMar.Bottom is null || pgMar.Left is null || pgMar.Right is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("One or more of the PageMargin elements is null."); }

var top = pgMar.Top.Value; var bottom = pgMar.Bottom.Value; var left = pgMar.Left.Value; var right = pgMar.Right.Value;

pgMar.Top = new Int32Value((int)left); pgMar.Bottom = new Int32Value((int)right); pgMar.Left = new UInt32Value((uint)System.Math.Max(0, bottom)); pgMar.Right = new

UInt32Value((uint)System.Math.Max(0, top)); } } } } } }

To open an existing document, instantiate the WordprocessingDocument class as shown in the following using statement. In the same statement, open the word processing file at the specified filepath by using the Open method, with the Boolean parameter set to true to enable editing the document.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filePath, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## The Structure of a Table

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text.

The document might contain a table as in this example. A table is a set of paragraphs (and other block-level content) arranged in rows and columns . Tables in WordprocessingML are defined via the tbl element, which is analogous to the HTML table tag. Consider an empty one-cell table (that is, a table with one row and one column) and 1 point borders on all sides. This table is represented by the following WordprocessingML code example.

XML

<w:tbl> <w:tblPr> <w:tblW w:w="5000" w:type="pct"/> <w:tblBorders> <w:top w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> <w:left w:val="single" w:sz="4 w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> <w:bottom w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> <w:right w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> </w:tblBorders> </w:tblPr> <w:tblGrid> <w:gridCol w:w="10296"/> </w:tblGrid> <w:tr> <w:tc> <w:tcPr> <w:tcW w:w="0" w:type="auto"/> </w:tcPr> <w:p/> </w:tc> </w:tr> </w:tbl>

This table specifies table-wide properties of 100% of page width using the tblW element, a set of table borders using the tblBorders element, the table grid, which defines a set of shared vertical edges within the table using the tblGrid element, and a single table row using the tr element.

## How the Sample Code Works

In the sample code, after you open the document in the using statement, you locate the first table in the document. Then you locate the second row in the table by finding the row whose index is 1. Next, you locate the third cell in that row whose index is 2, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// Find the first table in the document. Table table = doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Elements<Table> ().First();

// Find the second row in the table. TableRow row = table.Elements<TableRow>().ElementAt(1);

// Find the third cell in the row. TableCell cell = row.Elements<TableCell>().ElementAt(2);

After you have located the target cell, you locate the first run in the first paragraph of the cell and replace the text with the passed in text. The following code example shows these actions.

C#

C#

// Find the first paragraph in the table cell. Paragraph p = cell.Elements<Paragraph>().First();

// Find the first run in the paragraph. Run r = p.Elements<Run>().First();

// Set the text for the run. Text t = r.Elements<Text>().First(); t.Text = txt;

## Change Text in a Cell in a Table

The following code example shows how to change the text in the specified table cell in a word processing document. The code example expects that the document, whose file name and path are passed as an argument to the ChangeTextInCell method, contains a table. The code example also expects that the table has at least two rows and three columns, and that the table contains text in the cell that is located at the second row and the third column position. When you call the ChangeTextInCell method in your program, the text in the cell at the specified location will be replaced by the text that you pass in as the second argument to the ChangeTextInCell method.

ﾉ Expand table

Some text Some text Some text

Some text Some text The text from the second argument

## Sample Code

The ChangeTextInCell method changes the text in the second row and the third column of the first table found in the file. You call it by passing a full path to the file as the first parameter, and the text to use as the second parameter. For example, the following call to the ChangeTextInCell method changes the text in the specified cell to "The text from the API example."

C#

C#

ChangeTextInCell(args[0], args[1]);

Following is the complete code example.

C#

C#

// Change the text in a table in a word processing document. static void ChangeTextInCell(string filePath, string txt) { // Use the file name and path passed in as an argument to // open an existing document. using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filePath, true)) { if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null || doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Find the first table in the document. Table table = doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Elements<Table> ().First();

// Find the second row in the table. TableRow row = table.Elements<TableRow>().ElementAt(1);

// Find the third cell in the row. TableCell cell = row.Elements<TableCell>().ElementAt(2); // Find the first paragraph in the table cell. Paragraph p = cell.Elements<Paragraph>().First();

// Find the first run in the paragraph. Run r = p.Elements<Run>().First();

// Set the text for the run. Text t = r.Elements<Text>().First(); t.Text = txt; } }

How to: Change Text in a Table in a Word Processing Document

Extension Methods (Visual Basic)

# Convert a word processing document

# from the DOCM to the DOCX file format

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically convert a Microsoft Word document that contains VBA code (and has a .docm extension) to a standard document (with a .docx extension). It contains an example ConvertDOCMtoDOCX method to illustrate this task.

## ConvertDOCMtoDOCX Method

The ConvertDOCMtoDOCX sample method can be used to convert a Word document that contains VBA code (and has a .docm extension) to a standard document (with a .docx extension). Use this method to remove the macros and the vbaProject part that contains them from a document stored in .docm file format. The method accepts a single parameter that indicates the file name of the file to convert.

C#

static void ConvertDOCMtoDOCX(string fileName)

The complete code listing for the method can be found in the Sample Code section.

## Calling the Sample Method

To call the sample method, pass a string that contains the name of the file to convert. The following sample code shows an example.

C#

ConvertDOCMtoDOCX(args[0]);

## Parts and the vbaProject Part

A word processing document package such as a file that has a .docx or .docm extension is in fact a .zip file that consists of several parts. You can think of each part as being similar to an external file. A part has a particular content type, and can contain content equivalent to an external XML file, binary file, image file, and so on, depending on the type. The standard that defines how Open XML documents are stored in .zip files is called the Open Packaging Conventions. For more information about the Open Packaging Conventions, see ISO/IEC 29500-2:2021 .

When you create and save a VBA macro in a document, Word adds a new binary part named vbaProject that contains the internal representation of your macro project. The following image from the Document Explorer in the Open XML SDK Productivity Tool for Microsoft Office shows the document parts in a sample document that contains a macro. The vbaProject part is highlighted.

Figure 1. The vbaProject part

The task of converting a macro enabled document to one that is not macro enabled therefore consists largely of removing the vbaProject part from the document package.

## How the Code Works

The sample code modifies the document that you specify, verifying that the document contains a vbaProject part, and deleting the part. After the code deletes the part, it changes the document type internally and renames the document so that it uses the .docx extension.

The code starts by opening the document by using the Open method and indicating that the document should be open for read/write access (the final true parameter). The code then retrieves a reference to the Document part by using the MainDocumentPart property of the word processing document.

C#

bool fileChanged = false;

using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { // Access the main document part. var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null.");

It is not enough to delete the part from the document. You must also convert the document type, internally. The Open XML SDK provides a way to perform this task: You can call the document ChangeDocumentType method and indicate the new document type (in this case, supply the WordprocessingDocumentType.Document enumerated value).

You must also rename the file. However, you cannot do that while the file is open. The using block closes the file at the end of the block. Therefore, you must have some way to indicate to the code after the block that you have modified the file: The fileChanged Boolean variable tracks this information for you.

C#

// Look for the vbaProject part. If it is there, delete it. var vbaPart = docPart.VbaProjectPart; if (vbaPart is not null) { // Delete the vbaProject part. docPart.DeletePart(vbaPart);

The code then renames the newly modified document. To do this, the code creates a new file name by changing the extension; verifies that the output file exists and deletes it, and finally moves the file from the old file name to the new file name.

C#

// If anything goes wrong in this file handling, // the code will raise an exception back to the caller. if (fileChanged) { // Create the new .docx filename. var newFileName = Path.ChangeExtension(fileName, ".docx");

// If it already exists, it will be deleted! if (File.Exists(newFileName)) { File.Delete(newFileName); }

// Rename the file. File.Move(fileName, newFileName); }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete ConvertDOCMtoDOCX code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

static void ConvertDOCMtoDOCX(string fileName) { bool fileChanged = false;

using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { // Access the main document part. var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null.");

// Look for the vbaProject part. If it is there, delete it. var vbaPart = docPart.VbaProjectPart; if (vbaPart is not null) { // Delete the vbaProject part. docPart.DeletePart(vbaPart);

// Change the document type to // not macro-enabled.

document.ChangeDocumentType(WordprocessingDocumentType.Document);

// Track that the document has been changed. fileChanged = true; } }

// If anything goes wrong in this file handling, // the code will raise an exception back to the caller. if (fileChanged) {

// Create the new .docx filename. var newFileName = Path.ChangeExtension(fileName, ".docx");

// If it already exists, it will be deleted! if (File.Exists(newFileName)) { File.Delete(newFileName); }

// Rename the file. File.Move(fileName, newFileName); } }

# Create and add a character style to a

# word processing document

Article • 05/13/2024

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically create and add a character style to a word processing document. It contains an example CreateAndAddCharacterStyle method to illustrate this task, plus a supplemental example method to add the styles part when it is necessary.

## CreateAndAddCharacterStyle Method

The CreateAndAddCharacterStyle sample method can be used to add a style to a word processing document. You must first obtain a reference to the style definitions part in the document to which you want to add the style. See the Calling the Sample Method section for an example that shows how to do this.

The method accepts four parameters that indicate: the path to the file to edit, the style id of the style (an internal identifier), the name of the style (for external use in the user interface), and optionally, any style aliases (alternate names for use in the user interface).

C#

C#

static void CreateAndAddCharacterStyle(string filePath, string styleid, string stylename, string aliases = "")

The complete code listing for the method can be found in the Sample Code section.

## About Style IDs, Style Names, and Aliases

The style ID is used by the document to refer to the style, and can be thought of as its primary identifier. Typically, you use the style ID to identify a style in code. A style can also have a separate display name shown in the user interface. Often, the style name, therefore, appears in proper case and with spacing (for example, Heading 1), while the style ID is more succinct (for example, heading1) and intended for internal use. Aliases specify alternate style names that can be used in an application's user interface.

For example, consider the following XML code example taken from a style definition.

XML

<w:style w:type="character" w:styleId="OverdueAmountChar" . . . <w:aliases w:val="Late Due, Late Amount" /> <w:name w:val="Overdue Amount Char" /> . . . </w:style>

The style element styleId attribute defines the main internal identifier of the style, the style ID (OverdueAmountChar). The aliases element specifies two alternate style names, Late Due, and Late Amount, which are comma separated. Each name must be separated by one or more commas. Finally, the name element specifies the primary style name, which is the one typically shown in an application's user interface.

## Calling the Sample Method

You can use the CreateAndAddCharacterStyle example method to create and add a named style to a word processing document using the Open XML SDK. The following code example shows how to open and obtain a reference to a word processing document, retrieve a reference to the document's style definitions part, and then call the CreateAndAddCharacterStyle method.

To call the method, you pass a reference to the file to edit as the first parameter, the style ID of the style as the second parameter, the name of the style as the third parameter, and optionally, any style aliases as the fourth parameter. For example, the following code example creates the "Overdue Amount Char" character style in a sample file that's name comes from the first argument to the method. It also creates three runs of text in a paragraph, and applies the style to the second run.

C#

C#

static void AddStylesToPackage(string filePath) { // Create and add the character style with the style id, style name, and // aliases specified. CreateAndAddCharacterStyle( filePath, "OverdueAmountChar", "Overdue Amount Char", "Late Due, Late Amount");

using (WordprocessingDocument doc =

WordprocessingDocument.Open(filePath, true)) {

// Add a paragraph with a run with some text. Paragraph p = new Paragraph( new Run( new Text("this is some text ") { Space = SpaceProcessingModeValues.Preserve }));

// Add another run with some text. p.AppendChild<Run>(new Run(new Text("in a run ") { Space = SpaceProcessingModeValues.Preserve }));

// Add another run with some text. p.AppendChild<Run>(new Run(new Text("in a paragraph.") { Space = SpaceProcessingModeValues.Preserve }));

// Add the paragraph as a child element of the w:body. doc?.MainDocumentPart?.Document?.Body?.AppendChild(p);

// Get a reference to the second run (indexed starting with 0). Run r = p.Descendants<Run>().ElementAtOrDefault(1)!;

// If the Run has no RunProperties object, create one and get a reference to it. RunProperties rPr = r.RunProperties ?? r.PrependChild(new RunProperties());

// Set the character style of the run. if (rPr.RunStyle is null) { rPr.RunStyle = new RunStyle(); rPr.RunStyle.Val = "OverdueAmountChar"; } } }

## Style Types

WordprocessingML supports six style types, four of which you can specify using the type attribute on the style element. The following information, from section 17.7.4.17 in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification, introduces style types.

Style types refers to the property on a style which defines the type of style created with this style definition. WordprocessingML supports six types of style definitions by the values for the style definition's type attribute:

Paragraph styles Character styles

Linked styles (paragraph + character) Accomplished via the link element (§17.7.4.6). Table styles Numbering styles Default paragraph + character properties

Consider a style called Heading 1 in a document as shown in the following code example.

XML

<w:style w:type="paragraph" w:styleId="Heading1"> <w:name w:val="heading 1"/> <w:basedOn w:val="Normal"/> <w:next w:val="Normal"/> <w:link w:val="Heading1Char"/> <w:uiPriority w:val="1"/> <w:qformat/> <w:rsid w:val="00F303CE"/> … </w:style>

The type attribute has a value of paragraph, which indicates that the following style definition is a paragraph style.

You can set the paragraph, character, table and numbering styles types by specifying the corresponding value in the style element's type attribute.

## Character Style Type

You specify character as the style type by setting the value of the type attribute on the style element to "character".

The following information from section 17.7.9 of the ISO/IEC 29500 specification discusses character styles. Be aware that section numbers preceded by § indicate sections in the ISO specification.

### 17.7.9 Run (Character) Styles

Character styles are styles which apply to the contents of one or more runs of text within a document's contents. This definition implies that the style can only define character properties (properties which apply to text within a paragraph) because it cannot be applied to paragraphs. Character styles can only be referenced by runs within a document, and they shall be referenced by the rStyle element within a run's run properties element.

A character style has two defining style type-specific characteristics:

The type attribute on the style has a value of character, which indicates that the following style definition is a character style.

The style specifies only character-level properties using the rPr element. In this case, the run properties are the set of properties applied to each run which is of this style.

The character style is then applied to runs by referencing the styleId attribute value for this style in the run properties' rStyle element.

The following image shows some text that has had a character style applied. A character style can only be applied to a sub-paragraph level range of text.

Figure 1. Text with a character style applied

## How the Code Works

The CreateAndAddCharacterStyle method begins by opening the specified file and retrieving a reference to the styles element in the styles part. The styles element is the root element of the part and contains all of the individual style elements. If the reference is null, the styles element is created and saved to the part.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filePath, true)) { // Get access to the root element of the styles part. Styles? styles = wordprocessingDocument?.MainDocumentPart?.StyleDefinitionsPart?.Styles ?? AddStylesPartToPackage(wordprocessingDocument).Styles;

## Creating the Style

To create the style, the code instantiates the Style class and sets certain properties, such as the Type of style (paragraph), the StyleId, and whether the style is a CustomStyle.

C#

C#

// Create a new character style and specify some of the attributes. Style style = new Style() { Type = StyleValues.Character, StyleId = styleid, CustomStyle = true };

The code results in the following XML.

XML

<w:style w:type="character" w:styleId="OverdueAmountChar" w:customStyle="true" xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> </w:style>

The code next creates the child elements of the style, which define the properties of the style. To create an element, you instantiate its corresponding class, and then call the Append method to add the child element to the style. For more information about these properties, see section 17.7 of the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

C#

C#

// Create and add the child elements (properties of the style). Aliases aliases1 = new Aliases() { Val = aliases }; StyleName styleName1 = new StyleName() { Val = stylename }; LinkedStyle linkedStyle1 = new LinkedStyle() { Val = "OverdueAmountPara" };

if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(aliases)) { style.Append(aliases1); }

style.Append(styleName1); style.Append(linkedStyle1);

Next, the code instantiates a StyleRunProperties object to create a rPr (Run Properties) element. You specify the character properties that apply to the style, such as font and color, in this element. The properties are then appended as children of the rPr element.

When the run properties are created, the code appends the rPr element to the style, and the style element to the styles root element in the styles part.

C#

C#

// Create the StyleRunProperties object and specify some of the run properties. StyleRunProperties styleRunProperties1 = new StyleRunProperties(); Bold bold1 = new Bold(); Color color1 = new Color() { ThemeColor = ThemeColorValues.Accent2 }; RunFonts font1 = new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Tahoma" }; Italic italic1 = new Italic(); // Specify a 24 point size. FontSize fontSize1 = new FontSize() { Val = "48" }; styleRunProperties1.Append(font1); styleRunProperties1.Append(fontSize1); styleRunProperties1.Append(color1); styleRunProperties1.Append(bold1); styleRunProperties1.Append(italic1);

// Add the run properties to the style. style.Append(styleRunProperties1);

// Add the style to the styles part. styles.Append(style);

The following XML shows the final style generated by the code shown here.

XML

<w:style w:type="character" w:styleId="OverdueAmountChar" w:customStyle="true" xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:aliases w:val="Late Due, Late Amount" /> <w:name w:val="Overdue Amount Char" /> <w:link w:val="OverdueAmountPara" /> <w:rPr> <w:rFonts w:ascii="Tahoma" />

<w:sz w:val="48" /> <w:color w:themeColor="accent2" /> <w:b /> <w:i /> </w:rPr> </w:style>

## Applying the Character Style

Once you have the style created, you can apply it to a run by referencing the styleId attribute value for this style in the run properties' rStyle element. The following code example shows how to apply a style to a run referenced by the variable r. The style ID of the style to apply, OverdueAmountChar in this example, is stored in the RunStyle property of the rPr object. This property represents the run properties' rStyle element.

C#

C#

// If the Run has no RunProperties object, create one and get a reference to it. RunProperties rPr = r.RunProperties ?? r.PrependChild(new RunProperties());

// Set the character style of the run. if (rPr.RunStyle is null) { rPr.RunStyle = new RunStyle(); rPr.RunStyle.Val = "OverdueAmountChar"; }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete CreateAndAddCharacterStyle code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// Create a new character style with the specified style id, style name and aliases and // add it to the specified file.

static void CreateAndAddCharacterStyle(string filePath, string styleid, string stylename, string aliases = "") { using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filePath, true)) { // Get access to the root element of the styles part. Styles? styles = wordprocessingDocument?.MainDocumentPart?.StyleDefinitionsPart?.Styles ?? AddStylesPartToPackage(wordprocessingDocument).Styles;

if (styles is not null) { // Create a new character style and specify some of the attributes. Style style = new Style() { Type = StyleValues.Character, StyleId = styleid, CustomStyle = true };

// Create and add the child elements (properties of the style). Aliases aliases1 = new Aliases() { Val = aliases }; StyleName styleName1 = new StyleName() { Val = stylename }; LinkedStyle linkedStyle1 = new LinkedStyle() { Val = "OverdueAmountPara" };

if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(aliases)) { style.Append(aliases1); }

style.Append(styleName1); style.Append(linkedStyle1);

// Create the StyleRunProperties object and specify some of the run properties. StyleRunProperties styleRunProperties1 = new StyleRunProperties(); Bold bold1 = new Bold(); Color color1 = new Color() { ThemeColor = ThemeColorValues.Accent2 }; RunFonts font1 = new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Tahoma" }; Italic italic1 = new Italic(); // Specify a 24 point size. FontSize fontSize1 = new FontSize() { Val = "48" }; styleRunProperties1.Append(font1); styleRunProperties1.Append(fontSize1); styleRunProperties1.Append(color1); styleRunProperties1.Append(bold1); styleRunProperties1.Append(italic1);

// Add the run properties to the style.

style.Append(styleRunProperties1);

// Add the style to the styles part. styles.Append(style); } } }

// Add a StylesDefinitionsPart to the document. Returns a reference to it. static StyleDefinitionsPart AddStylesPartToPackage(WordprocessingDocument? doc) { StyleDefinitionsPart part;

if (doc?.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

part = doc.MainDocumentPart.AddNewPart<StyleDefinitionsPart>(); Styles root = new Styles();

return part; }

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically create and add a paragraph style to a word processing document. It contains an example CreateAndAddParagraphStyle method to illustrate this task, plus a supplemental example method to add the styles part when necessary.

## CreateAndAddParagraphStyle Method

The CreateAndAddParagraphStyle sample method can be used to add a style to a word processing document. You must first obtain a reference to the style definitions part in the document to which you want to add the style.

The styleId attribute of the style element holds the main internal identifier of the style, the style ID (OverdueAmountPara). The aliases element specifies two alternate style names, Late Due, and Late Amount, which are comma separated. Each name must be separated by one or more commas. Finally, the name element specifies the primary style name, which is the one typically shown in the user interface of an application.

## Calling the Sample Method

Use the CreateAndAddParagraphStyle example method to create and add a named style to a word processing document using the Open XML SDK. The following code example shows how to open and obtain a reference to a word processing document, retrieve a reference to the style definitions part of the document, and then call the CreateAndAddParagraphStyle method.

To call the method, pass a reference to the style definitions part as the first parameter, the style ID of the style as the second parameter, the name of the style as the third parameter, and optionally, any style aliases as the fourth parameter. For example, the following code creates the "Overdue Amount Para" paragraph style. It also adds a paragraph of text, and applies the style to the paragraph.

C#

C#

string strDoc = args[0];

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(strDoc, true)) {

if (doc is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("document could not be opened"); }

MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = doc.MainDocumentPart ?? doc.AddMainDocumentPart();

// Get the Styles part for this document. StyleDefinitionsPart? part = mainDocumentPart.StyleDefinitionsPart;

// If the Styles part does not exist, add it and then add the style. if (part is null) { part = AddStylesPartToPackage(doc); }

// Set up a variable to hold the style ID. string parastyleid = "OverdueAmountPara";

// Create and add a paragraph style to the specified styles part // with the specified style ID, style name and aliases. CreateAndAddParagraphStyle(part, parastyleid, "Overdue Amount Para", "Late Due, Late Amount");

// Add a paragraph with a run and some text. Paragraph p = new Paragraph( new Run( new Text("This is some text in a run in a paragraph.")));

// Add the paragraph as a child element of the w:body element. mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ??= new Body();

mainDocumentPart.Document.Body.AppendChild(p);

// If the paragraph has no ParagraphProperties object, create one. if (p.Elements<ParagraphProperties>().Count() == 0) { p.PrependChild(new ParagraphProperties()); }

// Get a reference to the ParagraphProperties object. p.ParagraphProperties ??= new ParagraphProperties(); ParagraphProperties pPr = p.ParagraphProperties;

// If a ParagraphStyleId object doesn't exist, create one. pPr.ParagraphStyleId ??= new ParagraphStyleId();

// Set the style of the paragraph. pPr.ParagraphStyleId.Val = parastyleid; }

## Style Types

WordprocessingML supports six style types, four of which you can specify using the type attribute on the style element. The following information, from section 17.7.4.17 in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification, introduces style types.

Style types refers to the property on a style which defines the type of style created with this style definition. WordprocessingML supports six types of style definitions by the values for the style definition's type attribute:

Paragraph styles

Character styles

Linked styles (paragraph + character) [Note: Accomplished via the link element (§17.7.4.6). end note]

The type attribute has a value of paragraph, which indicates that the following style definition is a paragraph style.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

You can set the paragraph, character, table and numbering styles types by specifying the corresponding value in the type attribute of the style element.

## Paragraph Style Type

You specify paragraph as the style type by setting the value of the type attribute on the style element to "paragraph".

The following information from section 17.7.8 of the ISO/IEC 29500 specification discusses paragraph styles. Note that section numbers preceded by § indicate sections in the ISO specification.

## 17.7.8 Paragraph Styles

Paragraph styles are styles which apply to the contents of an entire paragraph as well as the paragraph mark. This definition implies that the style can define both character properties (properties which apply to text within the document) as well as paragraph properties (properties which apply to the positioning and appearance of the paragraph). Paragraph styles cannot be referenced by runs within a document; they shall be referenced by the pStyle element (§17.3.1.27) within a paragraph's paragraph properties element.

A paragraph style has three defining style type-specific characteristics:

The type attribute on the style has a value of paragraph, which indicates that the following style definition is a paragraph style.

The next element defines an editing behavior which supplies the paragraph style to be automatically applied to the next paragraph when ENTER is pressed at the end of a paragraph of this style.

The style specifies both paragraph-level and character-level properties using the pPr and rPr elements, respectively. In this case, the run properties are the set of properties applied to each run in the paragraph.

The paragraph style is then applied to paragraphs by referencing the styleId attribute value for this style in the paragraph properties' pStyle element.

## How the Code Works

The CreateAndAddParagraphStyle method begins by retrieving a reference to the styles element in the styles part. The styles element is the root element of the part and contains all of the individual style elements. If the reference is null, the styles element is created.

C#

C#

// Access the root element of the styles part. Styles? styles = styleDefinitionsPart.Styles;

if (styles is null) { styleDefinitionsPart.Styles = new Styles(); styles = styleDefinitionsPart.Styles; }

## Creating the Style

To create the style, the code instantiates the Style class and sets certain properties, such as the Type of style (paragraph), the StyleId, whether the style is a CustomStyle, and whether the style is the Default style for its type.

C#

C#

// Create a new paragraph style element and specify some of the attributes. Style style = new Style() { Type = StyleValues.Paragraph, StyleId = styleid, CustomStyle = true, Default = false };

The code results in the following XML.

XML

<w:styles xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:style w:type="paragraph" w:styleId="OverdueAmountPara" w:default="false" w:customStyle="true"> </w:style> </w:styles>

The code next creates the child elements of the style, which define the properties of the style. To create an element, you instantiate its corresponding class, and then call the Append method add the child element to the style. For more information about these properties, see section 17.7 of the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

C#

C#

// Create and add the child elements (properties of the style). Aliases aliases1 = new Aliases() { Val = aliases }; AutoRedefine autoredefine1 = new AutoRedefine() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; BasedOn basedon1 = new BasedOn() { Val = "Normal" }; LinkedStyle linkedStyle1 = new LinkedStyle() { Val = "OverdueAmountChar" }; Locked locked1 = new Locked() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; PrimaryStyle primarystyle1 = new PrimaryStyle() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.On }; StyleHidden stylehidden1 = new StyleHidden() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; SemiHidden semihidden1 = new SemiHidden() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; StyleName styleName1 = new StyleName() { Val = stylename }; NextParagraphStyle nextParagraphStyle1 = new NextParagraphStyle() { Val = "Normal" }; UIPriority uipriority1 = new UIPriority() { Val = 1 }; UnhideWhenUsed unhidewhenused1 = new UnhideWhenUsed() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.On };

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(aliases)) { style.Append(aliases1); }

style.Append(autoredefine1); style.Append(basedon1); style.Append(linkedStyle1); style.Append(locked1); style.Append(primarystyle1); style.Append(stylehidden1); style.Append(semihidden1); style.Append(styleName1);

style.Append(nextParagraphStyle1); style.Append(uipriority1); style.Append(unhidewhenused1);

Next, the code instantiates a StyleRunProperties object to create a rPr (Run Properties) element. You specify the character properties that apply to the style, such as font and color, in this element. The properties are then appended as children of the rPr element.

When the run properties are created, the code appends the rPr element to the style, and the style element to the styles root element in the styles part.

C#

C#

// Create the StyleRunProperties object and specify some of the run properties. StyleRunProperties styleRunProperties1 = new StyleRunProperties(); Bold bold1 = new Bold(); Color color1 = new Color() { ThemeColor = ThemeColorValues.Accent2 }; RunFonts font1 = new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Lucida Console" }; Italic italic1 = new Italic();

// Specify a 12 point size. FontSize fontSize1 = new FontSize() { Val = "24" }; styleRunProperties1.Append(bold1); styleRunProperties1.Append(color1); styleRunProperties1.Append(font1); styleRunProperties1.Append(fontSize1); styleRunProperties1.Append(italic1);

// Add the run properties to the style. style.Append(styleRunProperties1);

// Add the style to the styles part. styles.Append(style);

## Applying the Paragraph Style

When you have the style created, you can apply it to a paragraph by referencing the styleId attribute value for this style in the paragraph properties' pStyle element. The following code example shows how to apply a style to a paragraph referenced by the

variable p. The style ID of the style to apply is stored in the parastyleid variable, and the ParagraphStyleId property represents the paragraph properties' pStyle element.

C#

C#

// If the paragraph has no ParagraphProperties object, create one. if (p.Elements<ParagraphProperties>().Count() == 0) { p.PrependChild(new ParagraphProperties()); }

// Get a reference to the ParagraphProperties object. p.ParagraphProperties ??= new ParagraphProperties(); ParagraphProperties pPr = p.ParagraphProperties;

// If a ParagraphStyleId object doesn't exist, create one. pPr.ParagraphStyleId ??= new ParagraphStyleId();

// Set the style of the paragraph. pPr.ParagraphStyleId.Val = parastyleid;

## Sample Code

The following is the complete CreateAndAddParagraphStyle code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// Create a new paragraph style with the specified style ID, primary style name, and aliases and // add it to the specified style definitions part. static void CreateAndAddParagraphStyle(StyleDefinitionsPart styleDefinitionsPart, string styleid, string stylename, string aliases = "") { // Access the root element of the styles part. Styles? styles = styleDefinitionsPart.Styles;

if (styles is null) { styleDefinitionsPart.Styles = new Styles(); styles = styleDefinitionsPart.Styles;

}

// Create a new paragraph style element and specify some of the attributes. Style style = new Style() { Type = StyleValues.Paragraph, StyleId = styleid, CustomStyle = true, Default = false };

// Create and add the child elements (properties of the style). Aliases aliases1 = new Aliases() { Val = aliases }; AutoRedefine autoredefine1 = new AutoRedefine() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; BasedOn basedon1 = new BasedOn() { Val = "Normal" }; LinkedStyle linkedStyle1 = new LinkedStyle() { Val = "OverdueAmountChar" }; Locked locked1 = new Locked() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; PrimaryStyle primarystyle1 = new PrimaryStyle() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.On }; StyleHidden stylehidden1 = new StyleHidden() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; SemiHidden semihidden1 = new SemiHidden() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.Off }; StyleName styleName1 = new StyleName() { Val = stylename }; NextParagraphStyle nextParagraphStyle1 = new NextParagraphStyle() { Val = "Normal" }; UIPriority uipriority1 = new UIPriority() { Val = 1 }; UnhideWhenUsed unhidewhenused1 = new UnhideWhenUsed() { Val = OnOffOnlyValues.On };

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(aliases)) { style.Append(aliases1); }

style.Append(autoredefine1); style.Append(basedon1); style.Append(linkedStyle1); style.Append(locked1); style.Append(primarystyle1); style.Append(stylehidden1); style.Append(semihidden1); style.Append(styleName1); style.Append(nextParagraphStyle1); style.Append(uipriority1); style.Append(unhidewhenused1);

// Create the StyleRunProperties object and specify some of the run properties. StyleRunProperties styleRunProperties1 = new StyleRunProperties(); Bold bold1 = new Bold(); Color color1 = new Color() { ThemeColor = ThemeColorValues.Accent2

}; RunFonts font1 = new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Lucida Console" }; Italic italic1 = new Italic();

// Specify a 12 point size. FontSize fontSize1 = new FontSize() { Val = "24" }; styleRunProperties1.Append(bold1); styleRunProperties1.Append(color1); styleRunProperties1.Append(font1); styleRunProperties1.Append(fontSize1); styleRunProperties1.Append(italic1);

// Add the run properties to the style. style.Append(styleRunProperties1);

// Add the style to the styles part. styles.Append(style); }

// Add a StylesDefinitionsPart to the document. Returns a reference to it. static StyleDefinitionsPart AddStylesPartToPackage(WordprocessingDocument? doc) { StyleDefinitionsPart part;

if (doc?.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

part = doc.MainDocumentPart.AddNewPart<StyleDefinitionsPart>(); part.Styles = new Styles();

return part; }

string strDoc = args[0];

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(strDoc, true)) { if (doc is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("document could not be opened"); }

MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = doc.MainDocumentPart ?? doc.AddMainDocumentPart();

// Get the Styles part for this document. StyleDefinitionsPart? part = mainDocumentPart.StyleDefinitionsPart;

// If the Styles part does not exist, add it and then add the style. if (part is null)

{ part = AddStylesPartToPackage(doc); }

// Set up a variable to hold the style ID. string parastyleid = "OverdueAmountPara";

// Create and add a paragraph style to the specified styles part // with the specified style ID, style name and aliases. CreateAndAddParagraphStyle(part, parastyleid, "Overdue Amount Para", "Late Due, Late Amount");

// Add a paragraph with a run and some text. Paragraph p = new Paragraph( new Run( new Text("This is some text in a run in a paragraph.")));

// Add the paragraph as a child element of the w:body element. mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ??= new Body();

mainDocumentPart.Document.Body.AppendChild(p);

// If the paragraph has no ParagraphProperties object, create one. if (p.Elements<ParagraphProperties>().Count() == 0) { p.PrependChild(new ParagraphProperties()); }

// Get a reference to the ParagraphProperties object. p.ParagraphProperties ??= new ParagraphProperties(); ParagraphProperties pPr = p.ParagraphProperties;

// If a ParagraphStyleId object doesn't exist, create one. pPr.ParagraphStyleId ??= new ParagraphStyleId();

// Set the style of the paragraph. pPr.ParagraphStyleId.Val = parastyleid; }

# Create a word processing document by

# providing a file name

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically create a word processing document.

## Creating a WordprocessingDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the WordprocessingDocument class represents a Word document package. To create a Word document, you create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class and populate it with parts. At a minimum, the document must have a main document part that serves as a container for the main text of the document. The text is represented in the package as XML using WordprocessingML markup.

To create the class instance you call the Create(String, WordprocessingDocumentType) method. Several Create methods are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the Create method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a full path string that represents the document that you want to create. The second parameter is a member of the WordprocessingDocumentType enumeration. This parameter represents the type of document. For example, there is a different member of the WordProcessingDocumentType enumeration for each of document, template, and the macro enabled variety of document and template.

７ Note

Carefully select the appropriate WordProcessingDocumentType and verify that the persisted file has the correct, matching file extension. If the WordProcessingDocumentType does not match the file extension, an error occurs when you open the file in Microsoft Word.

The code that calls the Create method is part of a using statement followed by a bracketed block, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Create(filepath, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document)) {

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

Once you have created the Word document package, you can add parts to it. To add the main document part you call the AddMainDocumentPart method of the WordprocessingDocument class. Having done that, you can set about adding the document structure and text.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p>

</w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Generating the WordprocessingML Markup

To create the basic document structure using the Open XML SDK, you instantiate the Document class, assign it to the Document property of the main document part, and then add instances of the Body , Paragraph , Run and Text classes. This is shown in the sample code listing, and does the work of generating the required WordprocessingML markup. While the code in the sample listing calls the AppendChild method of each class, you can sometimes make code shorter and easier to read by using the technique shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

mainPart.Document = new Document( new Body( new Paragraph( new Run( new Text("Create text in body - CreateWordprocessingDocument")))));

## Sample Code

The CreateWordprocessingDocument method can be used to create a basic Word document. You call it by passing a full path as the only parameter. The following code example creates the Invoice.docx file in the Public Documents folder.

C#

C#

CreateWordprocessingDocument(args[0]);

The file extension, .docx, matches the type of file specified by the WordprocessingDocumentType.Document parameter in the call to the Create method.

Following is the complete code example in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void CreateWordprocessingDocument(string filepath) { // Create a document by supplying the filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Create(filepath, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document)) { // Add a main document part. MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordDocument.AddMainDocumentPart();

// Create the document structure and add some text. mainPart.Document = new Document(); Body body = mainPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body()); Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run());

run.AppendChild(new Text("Create text in body - CreateWordprocessingDocument")); }

# Delete comments by all or a specific

# author in a word processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically delete comments by all or a specific author in a word processing document, without having to load the document into Microsoft Word. It contains an example DeleteComments method to illustrate this task.

## DeleteComments Method

You can use the DeleteComments method to delete all of the comments from a word processing document, or only those written by a specific author. As shown in the following code, the method accepts two parameters that indicate the name of the document to modify (string) and, optionally, the name of the author whose comments you want to delete (string). If you supply an author name, the code deletes comments written by the specified author. If you do not supply an author name, the code deletes all comments.

C#

// Delete comments by a specific author. Pass an empty string for the // author to delete all comments, by all authors. static void DeleteComments(string fileName, string author = "")

## Calling the DeleteComments Method

To call the DeleteComments method, provide the required parameters as shown in the following code.

C#

if (args is [{ } fileName, { } author]) { DeleteComments(fileName, author);

} else if (args is [{ } fileName2]) { DeleteComments(fileName2); }

## How the Code Works

The following code starts by opening the document, using the WordprocessingDocument.Open method and indicating that the document should be open for read/write access (the final true parameter value). Next, the code retrieves a reference to the comments part, using the WordprocessingCommentsPart property of the main document part, after having retrieved a reference to the main document part from the MainDocumentPart property of the word processing document. If the comments part is missing, there is no point in proceeding, as there cannot be any comments to delete.

C#

// Get an existing Wordprocessing document. using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) {

if (document.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

// Set commentPart to the document WordprocessingCommentsPart, // if it exists. WordprocessingCommentsPart? commentPart = document.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart;

// If no WordprocessingCommentsPart exists, there can be no // comments. Stop execution and return from the method. if (commentPart is null) { return; }

## Creating the List of Comments

The code next performs two tasks: creating a list of all the comments to delete, and creating a list of comment IDs that correspond to the comments to delete. Given these lists, the code can both delete the comments from the comments part that contains the comments, and delete the references to the comments from the document part.The following code starts by retrieving a list of Comment elements. To retrieve the list, it converts the Elements() collection exposed by the commentPart variable into a list of Comment objects.

C#

List<Comment> commentsToDelete = commentPart.Comments.Elements<Comment> ().ToList();

So far, the list of comments contains all of the comments. If the author parameter is not an empty string, the following code limits the list to only those comments where the Author property matches the parameter you supplied.

C#

if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(author)) { commentsToDelete = commentsToDelete.Where(c => c.Author == author).ToList(); }

Before deleting any comments, the code retrieves a list of comments ID values, so that it can later delete matching elements from the document part. The call to the Select method effectively projects the list of comments, retrieving an IEnumerable<T> of strings that contain all the comment ID values.

C#

IEnumerable<string?> commentIds = commentsToDelete.Where(r => r.Id is not null && r.Id.HasValue).Select(r => r.Id?.Value);

## Deleting Comments and Saving the Part

Given the commentsToDelete collection, to the following code loops through all the comments that require deleting and performs the deletion.

C#

// Delete each comment in commentToDelete from the // Comments collection. foreach (Comment c in commentsToDelete) { if (c is not null) { c.Remove(); } }

## Deleting Comment References in the

## Document

Although the code has successfully removed all the comments by this point, that is not enough. The code must also remove references to the comments from the document part. This action requires three steps because the comment reference includes the CommentRangeStart, CommentRangeEnd, and CommentReference elements, and the code must remove all three for each comment. Before performing any deletions, the code first retrieves a reference to the root element of the main document part, as shown in the following code.

C#

Document doc = document.MainDocumentPart.Document;

Given a reference to the document element, the following code performs its deletion loop three times, once for each of the different elements it must delete. In each case, the code looks for all descendants of the correct type ( CommentRangeStart , CommentRangeEnd , or CommentReference ) and limits the list to those whose Id property value is contained in the list of comment IDs to be deleted. Given the list of elements to be deleted, the code removes each element in turn. Finally, the code completes by saving the document.

C#

// Delete CommentRangeStart for each // deleted comment in the main document. List<CommentRangeStart> commentRangeStartToDelete = doc.Descendants<CommentRangeStart>() .Where(c => c.Id is not null && c.Id.HasValue && commentIds.Contains(c.Id.Value)) .ToList();

foreach (CommentRangeStart c in commentRangeStartToDelete) { c.Remove(); }

// Delete CommentRangeEnd for each deleted comment in the main document. List<CommentRangeEnd> commentRangeEndToDelete = doc.Descendants<CommentRangeEnd>() .Where(c => c.Id is not null && c.Id.HasValue && commentIds.Contains(c.Id.Value)) .ToList();

foreach (CommentRangeEnd c in commentRangeEndToDelete) { c.Remove(); }

// Delete CommentReference for each deleted comment in the main document. List<CommentReference> commentRangeReferenceToDelete = doc.Descendants<CommentReference>() .Where(c => c.Id is not null && c.Id.HasValue && commentIds.Contains(c.Id.Value)) .ToList();

foreach (CommentReference c in commentRangeReferenceToDelete) { c.Remove(); }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete code sample in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq;

// Delete comments by a specific author. Pass an empty string for the // author to delete all comments, by all authors. static void DeleteComments(string fileName, string author = "") { // Get an existing Wordprocessing document. using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) {

if (document.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

// Set commentPart to the document WordprocessingCommentsPart, // if it exists. WordprocessingCommentsPart? commentPart = document.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart;

// If no WordprocessingCommentsPart exists, there can be no // comments. Stop execution and return from the method. if (commentPart is null) { return; }

// Create a list of comments by the specified author, or // if the author name is empty, all authors. List<Comment> commentsToDelete = commentPart.Comments.Elements<Comment>().ToList();

if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(author)) { commentsToDelete = commentsToDelete.Where(c => c.Author == author).ToList(); }

IEnumerable<string?> commentIds = commentsToDelete.Where(r => r.Id is not null && r.Id.HasValue).Select(r => r.Id?.Value);

// Delete each comment in commentToDelete from the // Comments collection. foreach (Comment c in commentsToDelete) { if (c is not null)

{ c.Remove(); } }

Document doc = document.MainDocumentPart.Document;

// Delete CommentRangeStart for each // deleted comment in the main document. List<CommentRangeStart> commentRangeStartToDelete = doc.Descendants<CommentRangeStart>() .Where(c => c.Id is not null && c.Id.HasValue && commentIds.Contains(c.Id.Value)) .ToList();

foreach (CommentRangeStart c in commentRangeStartToDelete) { c.Remove(); }

// Delete CommentRangeEnd for each deleted comment in the main document. List<CommentRangeEnd> commentRangeEndToDelete = doc.Descendants<CommentRangeEnd>() .Where(c => c.Id is not null && c.Id.HasValue && commentIds.Contains(c.Id.Value)) .ToList();

foreach (CommentRangeEnd c in commentRangeEndToDelete) { c.Remove(); }

// Delete CommentReference for each deleted comment in the main document. List<CommentReference> commentRangeReferenceToDelete = doc.Descendants<CommentReference>() .Where(c => c.Id is not null && c.Id.HasValue && commentIds.Contains(c.Id.Value))

.ToList();

foreach (CommentReference c in commentRangeReferenceToDelete) { c.Remove(); } } }

# Extract styles from a word processing

# document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically extract the styles or stylesWithEffects part from a word processing document to an XDocument instance. It contains an example ExtractStylesPart method to illustrate this task.

## ExtractStylesPart Method

You can use the ExtractStylesPart sample method to retrieve an XDocument instance that contains the styles or stylesWithEffects part for a Microsoft Word document. Be aware that in a document created in Word 2010, there will only be a single styles part; Word 2013+ adds a second stylesWithEffects part. To provide for "round-tripping" a document from Word 2013+ to Word 2010 and back, Word 2013+ maintains both the original styles part and the new styles part. (The Office Open XML File Formats specification requires that Microsoft Word ignore any parts that it does not recognize; Word 2010 does not notice the stylesWithEffects part that Word 2013+ adds to the document.) You (and your application) must interpret the results of retrieving the styles or stylesWithEffects part.

The ExtractStylesPart procedure accepts a two parameters: the first parameter contains a string indicating the path of the file from which you want to extract styles, and the second indicates whether you want to retrieve the styles part, or the newer stylesWithEffects part (basically, you must call this procedure two times for Word 2013+ documents, retrieving each the part). The procedure returns an XDocument instance that contains the complete styles or stylesWithEffects part that you requested, with all the style information for the document (or a null reference, if the part you requested does not exist).

C#

C#

static XDocument? ExtractStylesPart(string fileName, string getStylesWithEffectsPart = "true")

The complete code listing for the method can be found in the Sample Code section.

## Calling the Sample Method

To call the sample method, pass a string for the first parameter that contains the file name of the document from which to extract the styles, and a Boolean for the second parameter that specifies whether the type of part to retrieve is the styleWithEffects part ( true ), or the styles part ( false ). The following sample code shows an example. When you have the XDocument instance you can do what you want with it; in the following sample code the content of the XDocument instance is displayed to the console.

C#

C#

if (args is [{ } fileName, { } getStyleWithEffectsPart]) { var styles = ExtractStylesPart(fileName, getStyleWithEffectsPart);

if (styles is not null) { Console.WriteLine(styles.ToString()); } } else if (args is [{ } fileName2]) { var styles = ExtractStylesPart(fileName2);

if (styles is not null) { Console.WriteLine(styles.ToString()); } }

## How the Code Works

The code starts by creating a variable named styles to contain the return value for the method. The code continues by opening the document by using the Open method and indicating that the document should be open for read-only access (the final false parameter). Given the open document, the code uses the MainDocumentPart property

to navigate to the main document part, and then prepares a variable named stylesPart to hold a reference to the styles part.

C#

C#

// Declare a variable to hold the XDocument. XDocument? styles = null;

// Open the document for read access and get a reference. using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if ( document.MainDocumentPart is null || (document.MainDocumentPart.StyleDefinitionsPart is null && document.MainDocumentPart.StylesWithEffectsPart is null) ) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or one or both of the Styles parts is null."); }

// Get a reference to the main document part. var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart;

// Assign a reference to the appropriate part to the // stylesPart variable. StylesPart? stylesPart = null;

## Find the Correct Styles Part

The code next retrieves a reference to the requested styles part by using the getStylesWithEffectsPart Boolean parameter. Based on this value, the code retrieves a specific property of the docPart variable, and stores it in the stylesPart variable.

C#

C#

if (getStylesWithEffectsPart.ToLower() == "true") { stylesPart = docPart.StylesWithEffectsPart; } else

{ stylesPart = docPart.StyleDefinitionsPart; }

## Retrieve the Part Contents

If the requested styles part exists, the code must return the contents of the part in an XDocument instance. Each part provides a GetStream() method, which returns a Stream. The code passes the Stream instance to the Create method, and then calls the Load method, passing the XmlNodeReader as a parameter.

C#

C#

if (stylesPart is not null) { using var reader = XmlNodeReader.Create(stylesPart.GetStream(FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read));

// Create the XDocument. styles = XDocument.Load(reader); }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete ExtractStylesPart code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using System; using System.IO; using System.Xml; using System.Xml.Linq;

// Extract the styles or stylesWithEffects part from a

// word processing document as an XDocument instance. static XDocument? ExtractStylesPart(string fileName, string getStylesWithEffectsPart = "true") { // Declare a variable to hold the XDocument. XDocument? styles = null;

// Open the document for read access and get a reference. using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if ( document.MainDocumentPart is null || (document.MainDocumentPart.StyleDefinitionsPart is null && document.MainDocumentPart.StylesWithEffectsPart is null) ) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or one or both of the Styles parts is null."); }

# Insert a comment into a word

# processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically add a comment to the first paragraph in a word processing document.

## Open the Existing Document for Editing

To open an existing document, instantiate the WordprocessingDocument class as shown in the following using statement. In the same statement, open the word processing file at the specified filepath by using the Open(String, Boolean) method, with the Boolean parameter set to true to enable editing in the document.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## How the Sample Code Works

After you open the document, you can find the first paragraph to attach a comment. The code finds the first paragraph by calling the First extension method on all the descendant elements of the document element that are of type Paragraph. The First

method is a member of the Enumerable class. The System.Linq.Enumerable class provides extension methods for objects that implement the IEnumerable<T> interface.

C#

C#

Paragraph firstParagraph = document.MainDocumentPart.Document.Descendants<Paragraph>().First(); wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments ??= new Comments(); string id = "0";

The code first determines whether a WordprocessingCommentsPart part exists. To do this, call the MainDocumentPart generic method, GetPartsCountOfType , and specify a kind of WordprocessingCommentsPart .

If a WordprocessingCommentsPart part exists, the code obtains a new Id value for the Comment object that it will add to the existing WordprocessingCommentsPart Comments collection object. It does this by finding the highest Id attribute value given to a Comment in the Comments collection object, incrementing the value by one, and then storing that as the Id value.If no WordprocessingCommentsPart part exists, the code creates one using the AddNewPart method of the MainDocumentPart object and then adds a Comments collection object to it.

C#

C#

if (document.MainDocumentPart.GetPartsOfType<WordprocessingCommentsPart> ().Count() > 0) { if (wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments.HasChildren) { // Obtain an unused ID. id = (wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments.Descendants<Comment> ().Select(e => { if (e.Id is not null && e.Id.Value is not null) { return int.Parse(e.Id.Value); } else { throw new ArgumentNullException("Comment id and/or value are null.");

} }) .Max() + 1).ToString(); } }

The Comment and Comments objects represent comment and comments elements, respectively, in the Open XML Wordprocessing schema. A Comment must be added to a Comments object so the code first instantiates a Comments object (using the string arguments author , initials , and comments that were passed in to the AddCommentOnFirstParagraph method).

The comment is represented by the following WordprocessingML code example. .

XML

<w:comment w:id="1" w:initials="User"> ... </w:comment>

The code then appends the Comment to the Comments object. This creates the required XML document object model (DOM) tree structure in memory which consists of a comments parent element with comment child elements under it.

C#

C#

Paragraph p = new Paragraph(new Run(new Text(comment))); Comment cmt = new Comment() { Id = id, Author = author, Initials = initials, Date = DateTime.Now }; cmt.AppendChild(p); wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments.AppendChild(cmt);

The following WordprocessingML code example represents the content of a comments part in a WordprocessingML document.

XML

<w:comments> <w:comment … > … </w:comment> </w:comments>

With the Comment object instantiated, the code associates the Comment with a range in the Wordprocessing document. CommentRangeStart and CommentRangeEnd objects correspond to the commentRangeStart and commentRangeEnd elements in the Open XML Wordprocessing schema. A CommentRangeStart object is given as the argument to the InsertBefore method of the Paragraph object and a CommentRangeEnd object is passed to the InsertAfter method. This creates a comment range that extends from immediately before the first character of the first paragraph in the Wordprocessing document to immediately after the last character of the first paragraph.

A CommentReference object represents a commentReference element in the Open XML Wordprocessing schema. A commentReference links a specific comment in the WordprocessingCommentsPart part (the Comments.xml file in the Wordprocessing package) to a specific location in the document body (the MainDocumentPart part contained in the Document.xml file in the Wordprocessing package). The id attribute of the comment, commentRangeStart, commentRangeEnd, and commentReference is the same for a given comment, so the commentReference id attribute must match the comment id attribute value that it links to. In the sample, the code adds a commentReference element by using the API, and instantiates a CommentReference object, specifying the Id value, and then adds it to a Run object.

C#

C#

firstParagraph.InsertBefore(new CommentRangeStart() { Id = id }, firstParagraph.GetFirstChild<Run>());

// Insert the new CommentRangeEnd after last run of paragraph. var cmtEnd = firstParagraph.InsertAfter(new CommentRangeEnd() { Id = id }, firstParagraph.Elements<Run>().Last());

// Compose a run with CommentReference and insert it. firstParagraph.InsertAfter(new Run(new CommentReference() { Id = id }), cmtEnd);

## Sample Code

The following code example shows how to create a comment and associate it with a range in a word processing document. To call the method AddCommentOnFirstParagraph pass in the path of the document, your name, your initials, and the comment text.

C#

C#

string fileName = args[0]; string author = args[1]; string initials = args[2]; string comment = args[3];

AddCommentOnFirstParagraph(fileName, author, initials, comment);

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// Insert a comment on the first paragraph. static void AddCommentOnFirstParagraph(string fileName, string author, string initials, string comment) { // Use the file name and path passed in as an // argument to open an existing Wordprocessing document. using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (document.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

WordprocessingCommentsPart wordprocessingCommentsPart = document.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart ?? document.MainDocumentPart.AddNewPart<WordprocessingCommentsPart>();

// Locate the first paragraph in the document. Paragraph firstParagraph = document.MainDocumentPart.Document.Descendants<Paragraph>().First(); wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments ??= new Comments(); string id = "0";

// Verify that the document contains a // WordProcessingCommentsPart part; if not, add a new one. if (document.MainDocumentPart.GetPartsOfType<WordprocessingCommentsPart> ().Count() > 0) { if (wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments.HasChildren) { // Obtain an unused ID. id = (wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments.Descendants<Comment>().Select(e => { if (e.Id is not null && e.Id.Value is not null) { return int.Parse(e.Id.Value); } else { throw new ArgumentNullException("Comment id and/or value are null."); } }) .Max() + 1).ToString(); } }

// Compose a new Comment and add it to the Comments part. Paragraph p = new Paragraph(new Run(new Text(comment))); Comment cmt = new Comment() { Id = id, Author = author, Initials = initials, Date = DateTime.Now }; cmt.AppendChild(p); wordprocessingCommentsPart.Comments.AppendChild(cmt);

// Specify the text range for the Comment. // Insert the new CommentRangeStart before the first run of paragraph. firstParagraph.InsertBefore(new CommentRangeStart() { Id = id }, firstParagraph.GetFirstChild<Run>());

// Insert the new CommentRangeEnd after last run of paragraph. var cmtEnd = firstParagraph.InsertAfter(new CommentRangeEnd() { Id = id }, firstParagraph.Elements<Run>().Last());

// Compose a run with CommentReference and insert it. firstParagraph.InsertAfter(new Run(new CommentReference() { Id = id }), cmtEnd); } }

The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement.

## The XML Representation of the Graphic Object

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Graphic Object Data element.

This element specifies the reference to a graphic object within the document. This graphic object is provided entirely by the document authors who choose to persist this data within the document.

[Note: Depending on the type of graphical object used not every generating application that supports the OOXML framework will have the ability to render the graphical object. end note]

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML Schema fragment defines the contents of this element

XML

<complexType name="CT_GraphicalObjectData"> <sequence> <any minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" processContents="strict"/> </sequence> <attribute name="uri" type="xsd:token"/> </complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After you have opened the document, add the ImagePart object to the MainDocumentPart object by using a file stream as shown in the following code segment.

C#

C#

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart;

ImagePart imagePart = mainPart.AddImagePart(ImagePartType.Jpeg);

using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open)) { imagePart.FeedData(stream); }

AddImageToBody(wordprocessingDocument, mainPart.GetIdOfPart(imagePart));

To add the image to the body, first define the reference of the image. Then, append the reference to the body. The element should be in a Run.

C#

C#

// Define the reference of the image. var element = new Drawing( new DW.Inline( new DW.Extent() { Cx = 990000L, Cy = 792000L }, new DW.EffectExtent() { LeftEdge = 0L, TopEdge = 0L, RightEdge = 0L, BottomEdge = 0L }, new DW.DocProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)1U, Name = "Picture 1" }, new DW.NonVisualGraphicFrameDrawingProperties( new A.GraphicFrameLocks() { NoChangeAspect = true }), new A.Graphic( new A.GraphicData( new PIC.Picture( new PIC.NonVisualPictureProperties( new PIC.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)0U, Name = "New Bitmap Image.jpg" }, new PIC.NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties()), new PIC.BlipFill( new A.Blip( new A.BlipExtensionList( new A.BlipExtension() { Uri = "{28A0092B-C50C-407E-A947- 70E740481C1C}" }) ) { Embed = relationshipId, CompressionState = A.BlipCompressionValues.Print }, new A.Stretch(

new A.FillRectangle())), new PIC.ShapeProperties( new A.Transform2D( new A.Offset() { X = 0L, Y = 0L }, new A.Extents() { Cx = 990000L, Cy = 792000L }), new A.PresetGeometry( new A.AdjustValueList() ) { Preset = A.ShapeTypeValues.Rectangle })) ) { Uri = "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/picture" }) ) { DistanceFromTop = (UInt32Value)0U, DistanceFromBottom = (UInt32Value)0U, DistanceFromLeft = (UInt32Value)0U, DistanceFromRight = (UInt32Value)0U, EditId = "50D07946" });

if (wordDoc.MainDocumentPart is null || wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Append the reference to body, the element should be in a Run. wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.AppendChild(new Paragraph(new Run(element)));

## Sample Code

The following code example adds a picture to an existing word document. In your code, you can call the InsertAPicture method by passing in the path of the word document, and the path of the file that contains the picture. For example, the following call inserts the picture.

C#

C#

string documentPath = args[0]; string picturePath = args[1];

InsertAPicture(documentPath, picturePath);

After you run the code, look at the file to see the inserted picture.

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System; using System.IO; using A = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing; using DW = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Wordprocessing; using PIC = DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Drawing.Pictures;

static void InsertAPicture(string document, string fileName) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(document, true)) { if (wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart;

ImagePart imagePart = mainPart.AddImagePart(ImagePartType.Jpeg);

using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open)) { imagePart.FeedData(stream); }

AddImageToBody(wordprocessingDocument, mainPart.GetIdOfPart(imagePart)); } }

static void AddImageToBody(WordprocessingDocument wordDoc, string relationshipId) {

// Define the reference of the image. var element = new Drawing( new DW.Inline( new DW.Extent() { Cx = 990000L, Cy = 792000L }, new DW.EffectExtent() { LeftEdge = 0L, TopEdge = 0L, RightEdge = 0L, BottomEdge = 0L }, new DW.DocProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)1U, Name = "Picture 1" }, new DW.NonVisualGraphicFrameDrawingProperties( new A.GraphicFrameLocks() { NoChangeAspect = true }), new A.Graphic( new A.GraphicData( new PIC.Picture( new PIC.NonVisualPictureProperties( new PIC.NonVisualDrawingProperties() { Id = (UInt32Value)0U, Name = "New Bitmap Image.jpg" }, new PIC.NonVisualPictureDrawingProperties()), new PIC.BlipFill( new A.Blip( new A.BlipExtensionList( new A.BlipExtension() { Uri = "{28A0092B-C50C-407E- A947-70E740481C1C}" }) ) { Embed = relationshipId, CompressionState = A.BlipCompressionValues.Print }, new A.Stretch( new A.FillRectangle())), new PIC.ShapeProperties( new A.Transform2D( new A.Offset() { X = 0L, Y = 0L }, new A.Extents() { Cx = 990000L, Cy = 792000L }), new A.PresetGeometry( new A.AdjustValueList()

) { Preset = A.ShapeTypeValues.Rectangle })) ) { Uri = "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/picture" }) ) { DistanceFromTop = (UInt32Value)0U, DistanceFromBottom = (UInt32Value)0U, DistanceFromLeft = (UInt32Value)0U, DistanceFromRight = (UInt32Value)0U, EditId = "50D07946" });

if (wordDoc.MainDocumentPart is null || wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Append the reference to body, the element should be in a Run. wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.AppendChild(new Paragraph(new Run(element))); }

# Insert a table into a word processing

# document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically insert a table into a word processing document.

## Getting a WordprocessingDocument Object

To open an existing document, instantiate the WordprocessingDocument class as shown in the following using statement. In the same statement, open the word processing file at the specified filepath by using the Open method, with the Boolean parameter set to true in order to enable editing the document.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true))

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## Structure of a Table

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text.The

document might contain a table as in this example. A table is a set of paragraphs (and other block-level content) arranged in rows and columns. Tables in WordprocessingML are defined via the tbl element, which is analogous to the HTML table tag. Consider an empty one-cell table (i.e. a table with one row, one column) and 1 point borders on all sides. This table is represented by the following WordprocessingML markup segment.

XML

<w:tbl> <w:tblPr> <w:tblW w:w="5000" w:type="pct"/> <w:tblBorders> <w:top w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> <w:left w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> <w:bottom w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> <w:right w:val="single" w:sz="4" w:space="0" w:color="auto"/> </w:tblBorders> </w:tblPr> <w:tblGrid> <w:gridCol w:w="10296"/> </w:tblGrid> <w:tr> <w:tc> <w:tcPr> <w:tcW w:w="0" w:type="auto"/> </w:tcPr> <w:p/> </w:tc> </w:tr> </w:tbl>

This table specifies table-wide properties of 100% of page width using the tblW element, a set of table borders using the tblBorders element, the table grid, which defines a set of shared vertical edges within the table using the tblGrid element, and a single table row using the tr element.

## How the Sample Code Works

In sample code, after you open the document in the using statement, you create a new Table object. Then you create a TableProperties object and specify its border information. The TableProperties class contains an overloaded constructor TableProperties() that takes a params array of type OpenXmlElement. The code uses this constructor to instantiate a TableProperties object with BorderType objects for each border, instantiating each BorderType and specifying its value using object initializers. After it has been instantiated, append the TableProperties object to the table.

C#

C#

// Create an empty table. Table table = new Table();

// Create a TableProperties object and specify its border information. TableProperties tblProp = new TableProperties( new TableBorders( new TopBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new BottomBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new LeftBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new RightBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new InsideHorizontalBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new InsideVerticalBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 } ) );

// Append the TableProperties object to the empty table. table.AppendChild<TableProperties>(tblProp);

The code creates a table row. This section of the code makes extensive use of the overloaded Append methods, which classes derived from OpenXmlElement inherit. The Append methods provide a way to either append a single element or to append a portion of an XML tree, to the end of the list of child elements under a given parent element. Next, the code creates a TableCell object, which represents an individual table cell, and specifies the width property of the table cell using a TableCellProperties object, and the cell content ("Hello, World!") using a Text object. In the Open XML Wordprocessing schema, a paragraph element ( <p\> ) contains run elements ( <r\> ) which, in turn, contain text elements ( <t\> ). To insert text within a table cell using the API, you must create a Paragraph object that contains a Run object that contains a Text object that contains the text you want to insert in the cell. You then append the Paragraph object to the TableCell object. This creates the proper XML structure for inserting text into a cell. The TableCell is then appended to the TableRow object.

C#

C#

// Create a row. TableRow tr = new TableRow();

// Create a cell. TableCell tc1 = new TableCell();

// Specify the width property of the table cell. tc1.Append(new TableCellProperties( new TableCellWidth() { Type = TableWidthUnitValues.Dxa, Width = "2400" }));

// Specify the table cell content. tc1.Append(new Paragraph(new Run(new Text("some text"))));

// Append the table cell to the table row. tr.Append(tc1);

The code then creates a second table cell. The final section of code creates another table cell using the overloaded TableCell constructor TableCell(String) that takes the OuterXml property of an existing TableCell object as its only argument. After creating the second table cell, the code appends the TableCell to the TableRow , appends the TableRow to the Table , and the Table to the Document object.

C#

C#

// Create a second table cell by copying the OuterXml value of the first table cell. TableCell tc2 = new TableCell(tc1.OuterXml);

// Append the table cell to the table row. tr.Append(tc2);

// Append the table row to the table. table.Append(tr);

if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null || doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Append the table to the document. doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Append(table);

## Sample Code

The following code example shows how to create a table, set its properties, insert text into a cell in the table, copy a cell, and then insert the table into a word processing document. You can invoke the method CreateTable by using the following call.

C#

C#

string filePath = args[0];

CreateTable(filePath);

After you run the program inspect the file to see the inserted table.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System;

// Insert a table into a word processing document. static void CreateTable(string fileName) { // Use the file name and path passed in as an argument // to open an existing Word document.

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { // Create an empty table. Table table = new Table();

// Create a TableProperties object and specify its border information. TableProperties tblProp = new TableProperties( new TableBorders( new TopBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new BottomBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new LeftBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new RightBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new InsideHorizontalBorder() { Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 }, new InsideVerticalBorder() {

Val = new EnumValue<BorderValues>(BorderValues.Dashed), Size = 24 } ) );

// Append the TableProperties object to the empty table. table.AppendChild<TableProperties>(tblProp);

// Create a row. TableRow tr = new TableRow();

// Create a cell. TableCell tc1 = new TableCell();

// Specify the width property of the table cell. tc1.Append(new TableCellProperties( new TableCellWidth() { Type = TableWidthUnitValues.Dxa, Width = "2400" }));

// Specify the table cell content. tc1.Append(new Paragraph(new Run(new Text("some text"))));

// Append the table cell to the table row. tr.Append(tc1);

// Create a second table cell by copying the OuterXml value of the first table cell. TableCell tc2 = new TableCell(tc1.OuterXml);

// Append the table cell to the table row. tr.Append(tc2);

// Append the table row to the table. table.Append(tr);

if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null || doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Append the table to the document. doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Append(table); } }

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically open and add text to a Word processing document.

## How to Open and Add Text to a Document

The Open XML SDK helps you create Word processing document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK to open a Word processing document and add text to it. In addition, this topic introduces the basic document structure of a WordprocessingML document, the associated XML elements, and their corresponding Open XML SDK classes.

## Create a WordprocessingDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the WordprocessingDocument class represents a Word document package. To open and work with a Word document, create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class from the document. When you create the instance from the document, you can then obtain access to the main document part that contains the text of the document. The text in the main document part is represented in the package as XML using WordprocessingML markup.

To create the class instance from the document you call one of the Open methods. Several are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the Open(String, Boolean) method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a full path string that represents the document to open. The second parameter is either true or false and represents whether you want the file to be opened for editing. Changes you make to the document will not be saved if this parameter is false .

The following code example calls the Open method.

C#

C#

// Open a WordprocessingDocument for editing using the filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) {

if (wordprocessingDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(wordprocessingDocument)); }

When you have opened the Word document package, you can add text to the main document part. To access the body of the main document part, create any missing elements and assign a reference to the document body, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// Assign a reference to the existing document body. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordprocessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ??= mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body()); Body body = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart!.Document!.Body!;

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Generate the WordprocessingML Markup to

## Add the Text

When you have access to the body of the main document part, add text by adding instances of the Paragraph, Run, and Text classes. This generates the required WordprocessingML markup. The following code example adds the paragraph.

C#

C#

// Add new text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text(txt));

## Sample Code

The example OpenAndAddTextToWordDocument method shown here can be used to open a Word document and append some text using the Open XML SDK. To call this method, pass a full path filename as the first parameter and the text to add as the second.

C#

C#

string file = args[0]; string txt = args[1];

OpenAndAddTextToWordDocument(args[0], args[1]);

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

Notice that the OpenAndAddTextToWordDocument method does not include an explicit call to Save . That is because the AutoSave feature is on by default and has not been disabled in the call to the Open method through use of OpenSettings .

# Open a word processing document for

# read-only access

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic describes how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically open a word processing document for read only access.

## When to Open a Document for Read-only

## Access

Sometimes you want to open a document to inspect or retrieve some information, and you want to do so in a way that ensures the document remains unchanged. In these instances, you want to open the document for read-only access. This how-to topic discusses several ways to programmatically open a read-only word processing document.

## Create a WordprocessingDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the WordprocessingDocument class represents a Word document package. To work with a Word document, first create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class from the document, and then work with that instance. Once you create the instance from the document, you can then obtain access to the main document part that contains the text of the document. Every Open XML package contains some number of parts. At a minimum, a WordprocessingDocument must contain a main document part that acts as a container for the main text of the document. The package can also contain additional parts. Notice that in a Word document, the text in the main document part is represented in the package as XML using WordprocessingML markup.

To create the class instance from the document you call one of the Open methods. Several Open methods are provided, each with a different signature. The methods that let you specify whether a document is editable are listed in the following table.

ﾉ Expand table

Open Method Class LibraryDescription Reference Topic

Open(String,Open(String, Boolean) Create an instance of the Boolean)WordprocessingDocument class from the specified file.

Open(Stream,Open(Stream,Create an instance of the Boolean)Boolean)WordprocessingDocument class from the specified IO stream.

Open(String,Open(String, Boolean,Create an instance of the Boolean,OpenSettings)WordprocessingDocument class from the OpenSettings)specified file.

Open(Stream,Open(Stream,Create an instance of the Boolean,Boolean,WordprocessingDocument class from the OpenSettings)OpenSettings)specified I/O stream.

The table above lists only those Open methods that accept a Boolean value as the second parameter to specify whether a document is editable. To open a document for read only access, you specify false for this parameter.

Notice that two of the Open methods create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class based on a string as the first parameter. The first example in the sample code uses this technique. It uses the first Open method in the table above; with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a string that represents the full path filename from which you want to open the document. The second parameter is either true or false ; this example uses false and indicates whether you want to open the file for editing.

The following code example calls the Open Method.

C#

C#

// Open a WordprocessingDocument based on a filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordProcessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, false))

The other two Open methods create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class based on an input/output stream. You might employ this approach, for instance, if you

have a Microsoft SharePoint Online application that uses stream input/output, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a document.

The following code example opens a document based on a stream.

C#

C#

// Get a stream of the wordprocessing document using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(filepath, FileMode.Open))

// Open a WordprocessingDocument for read-only access based on a stream. using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileStream, false))

Suppose you have an application that employs the Open XML support in the System.IO.Packaging namespace of the .NET Framework Class Library, and you want to use the Open XML SDK to work with a package read only. While the Open XML SDK includes method overloads that accept a Package as the first parameter, there is not one that takes a Boolean as the second parameter to indicate whether the document should be opened for editing.

The recommended method is to open the package as read-only to begin with prior to creating the instance of the WordprocessingDocument class, as shown in the second example in the sample code. The following code example performs this operation.

C#

C#

// Open System.IO.Packaging.Package. using (Package wordPackage = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)) // Open a WordprocessingDocument based on a package. using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(wordPackage))

Once you open the Word document package, you can access the main document part. To access the body of the main document part, you assign a reference to the existing document body, as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

// Assign a reference to the existing document body or create a new one if it is null. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordProcessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordProcessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document();

Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Generate the WordprocessingML Markup to

## Add Text and Attempt to Save

The sample code shows how you can add some text and attempt to save the changes to show that access is read-only. Once you have access to the body of the main document part, you add text by adding instances of the Paragraph, Run, and Text classes. This generates the required WordprocessingML markup. The following code example adds the paragraph, run, and text.

C#

C#

// Attempt to add some text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text("Append text in body, but text is not saved - OpenWordprocessingDocumentReadonly"));

// Call Save to generate an exception and show that access is read-only. // mainDocumentPart.Document.Save();

## Sample Code

The first example method shown here, OpenWordprocessingDocumentReadOnly , opens a Word document for read-only access. Call it by passing a full path to the file that you want to open. For example, the following code example opens the file path from the first command line argument for read-only access.

C#

C#

OpenWordprocessingDocumentReadonly(args[0]);

The second example method, OpenWordprocessingPackageReadonly , shows how to open a Word document for read-only access from a Package. Call it by passing a full path to the file that you want to open. For example, the following code example opens the file path from the first command line argument for read-only access.

C#

C#

OpenWordprocessingPackageReadonly(args[0]);

The third example method, OpenWordprocessingStreamReadonly , shows how to open a Word document for read-only access from a a stream. Call it by passing a full path to the file that you want to open. For example, the following code example opens the file path from the first command line argument for read-only access.

C#

C#

OpenWordprocessingStreamReadonly(args[0]);

） Important

If you uncomment the statement that saves the file, the program would throw an IOException because the file is opened for read-only access.

The following is the complete sample code in C# and VB.

C#

C#

static void OpenWordprocessingDocumentReadonly(string filepath) { // Open a WordprocessingDocument based on a filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordProcessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, false)) { if (wordProcessingDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(wordProcessingDocument)); }

// Assign a reference to the existing document body or create a new one if it is null. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordProcessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordProcessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document();

Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

// Attempt to add some text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text("Append text in body, but text is not saved - OpenWordprocessingDocumentReadonly"));

// Call Save to generate an exception and show that access is read-only. // mainDocumentPart.Document.Save(); } }

static void OpenWordprocessingPackageReadonly(string filepath) { // Open System.IO.Packaging.Package. using (Package wordPackage = Package.Open(filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)) // Open a WordprocessingDocument based on a package. using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(wordPackage)) { // Assign a reference to the existing document body or create a new one if it is null. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordDocument.AddMainDocumentPart();

mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document();

Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

// Attempt to add some text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text("Append text in body, but text is not saved - OpenWordprocessingPackageReadonly"));

// Call Save to generate an exception and show that access is read-only. // mainDocumentPart.Document.Save(); } }

static void OpenWordprocessingStreamReadonly(string filepath) { // Get a stream of the wordprocessing document using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(filepath, FileMode.Open))

// Open a WordprocessingDocument for read-only access based on a stream. using (WordprocessingDocument wordDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileStream, false)) {

// Assign a reference to the existing document body or create a new one if it is null. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document();

Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

// Attempt to add some text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text("Append text in body, but text is not saved - OpenWordprocessingStreamReadonly"));

// Call Save to generate an exception and show that access is read-only. // mainDocumentPart.Document.Save(); } }

# Open a word processing document from

# a stream

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically open a Word processing document from a stream.

## When to Open a Document from a Stream

If you have an application, such as a SharePoint application, that works with documents using stream input/output, and you want to employ the Open XML SDK to work with one of the documents, this is designed to be easy to do. This is particularly true if the document exists and you can open it using the Open XML SDK. However, suppose the document is an open stream at the point in your code where you need to employ the SDK to work with it? That is the scenario for this topic. The sample method in the sample code accepts an open stream as a parameter and then adds text to the document behind the stream using the Open XML SDK.

## Creating a WordprocessingDocument Object

In the Open XML SDK, the WordprocessingDocument class represents a Word document package. To work with a Word document, first create an instance of the WordprocessingDocument class from the document, and then work with that instance. When you create the instance from the document, you can then obtain access to the main document part that contains the text of the document. Every Open XML package contains some number of parts. At a minimum, a WordprocessingDocument must contain a main document part that acts as a container for the main text of the document. The package can also contain additional parts. Notice that in a Word document, the text in the main document part is represented in the package as XML using WordprocessingML markup.

To create the class instance from the document call the Open(Stream, Boolean) method.Several Open methods are provided, each with a different signature. The sample code in this topic uses the Open method with a signature that requires two parameters. The first parameter takes a handle to the stream from which you want to open the document. The second parameter is either true or false and represents whether the stream is opened for editing.

The following code example calls the Open method.

C#

C#

// Open a WordProcessingDocument based on a stream. using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(stream, true)) {

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<body/> Body The container for the block level structures such as paragraphs, tables, annotations and others specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 specification.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## How the Sample Code Works

When you open the Word document package, you can add text to the main document part. To access the body of the main document part you assign a reference to the document body, as shown in the following code segment.

C#

C#

// Assign a reference to the document body. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordprocessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

When you access to the body of the main document part, add text by adding instances of the Paragraph, Run, and Text classes. This generates the required WordprocessingML markup. The following lines from the sample code add the paragraph, run, and text.

C#

C#

// Add new text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph());

Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text(txt));

## Sample Code

The example OpenAndAddToWordprocessingStream method shown here can be used to open a Word document from an already open stream and append some text using the Open XML SDK. You can call it by passing a handle to an open stream as the first parameter and the text to add as the second. For example, the following code example opens the file specified in the first argument and adds text from the second argument to it.

C#

C#

string filePath = args[0]; string txt = args[1];

using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open)) { OpenAndAddToWordprocessingStream(fileStream, txt); }

７ Note

Notice that the OpenAddAddToWordprocessingStream method does not close the stream passed to it. The calling code must do that by wrapping the method call in a using statement or explicitly calling Dispose.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System.IO;

static void OpenAndAddToWordprocessingStream(Stream stream, string txt) { // Open a WordProcessingDocument based on a stream. using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(stream, true)) {

// Assign a reference to the document body. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordprocessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

// Add new text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text(txt)); } // Caller must close the stream. }

# Remove hidden text from a word

# processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically remove hidden text from a word processing document.

## Structure of a WordProcessingML Document

The basic document structure of a WordProcessingML document consists of the document and body elements, followed by one or more block level elements such as p , which represents a paragraph. A paragraph contains one or more r elements. The r stands for run, which is a region of text with a common set of properties, such as formatting. A run contains one or more t elements. The t element contains a range of text. The following code example shows the WordprocessingML markup for a document that contains the text "Example text."

XML

<w:document xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"> <w:body> <w:p> <w:r> <w:t>Example text.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p> </w:body> </w:document>

Using the Open XML SDK, you can create document structure and content using strongly-typed classes that correspond to WordprocessingML elements. You will find these classes in the namespace. The following table lists the class names of the classes that correspond to the document, body, p, r, and t elements.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingMLOpen XMLDescription ElementSDK Class

<document/> Document The root element for the main document part.

<p/> Paragraph A paragraph.

<r/> Run A run.

<t/> Text A range of text.

For more information about the overall structure of the parts and elements of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Structure of the Vanish Element

The vanish element plays an important role in hiding the text in a Word file. The Hidden formatting property is a toggle property, which means that its behavior differs between using it within a style definition and using it as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property toggles its current state. Setting it to false (or an equivalent) results in keeping the current setting unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting it to true or false sets the absolute state of the resulting property.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the vanish element.

vanish (Hidden Text)

This element specifies whether the contents of this run shall be hidden from display at display time in a document. [Note: The setting should affect the normal display of text, but an application can have settings to force hidden text to be displayed. end note]

This formatting property is a toggle property (§17.7.3).

If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then this text shall not be hidden when displayed in a document.

[Example: Consider a run of text which shall have the hidden text property turned on for the contents of the run. This constraint is specified using the following WordprocessingML:

XML

<w:rPr> <w:vanish /> </w:rPr>

This run declares that the vanish property is set for the contents of this run, so the contents of this run will be hidden when the document contents are displayed. end example]

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML schema segment defines the contents of this element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_OnOff"> <attribute name="val" type="ST_OnOff"/> </complexType>

The val property in the code above is a binary value that can be turned on or off. If given a value of on , 1 , or true the property is turned on. If given the value off , 0 , or false the property is turned off.

## How the Code Works

The WDDeleteHiddenText method works with the document you specify and removes all of the run elements that are hidden and removes extra vanish elements. The code starts by opening the document, using the Open method and indicating that the document should be opened for read/write access (the final true parameter). Given the open document, the code uses the MainDocumentPart property to navigate to the main document, storing the reference in a variable.

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(docName, true)) {

## Get a List of Vanish Elements

The code first checks that doc.MainDocumentPart and doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body are not null and throws an exception if one is missing. Then uses the Descendants() passing it the Vanish type to get an IEnumerable of the Vanish elements and casts them to a list.

C#

C#

if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null || doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Get a list of all the Vanish elements List<Vanish> vanishes = doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Descendants<Vanish>().ToList();

## Remove Runs with Hidden Text and Extra

## Vanish Elements

To remove the hidden text we next loop over the List of Vanish elements. The Vanish element is a child of the RunProperties but RunProperties can be a child of a Run or xref:DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing.ParagraphProperties>, so we get the parent and grandparent of each Vanish and check its type. Then if the grandparent is a Run we remove that run and if not we we remove the Vanish child elements from the parent.

C#

C#

// Loop over the list of Vanish elements foreach (Vanish vanish in vanishes) { var parent = vanish?.Parent; var grandparent = parent?.Parent;

// If the grandparent is a Run remove it if (grandparent is Run) { grandparent.Remove(); } // If it's not a run remove the Vanish else if (parent is not null) { parent.RemoveAllChildren<Vanish>(); } }

## Sample Code

７ Note

This example assumes that the file being opened contains some hidden text. In order to hide part of the file text, select it, and click CTRL+D to show the Font dialog box. Select the Hidden box and click OK.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq;

static void WDDeleteHiddenText(string docName) { // Given a document name, delete all the hidden text.

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(docName, true))

{

if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null || doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Get a list of all the Vanish elements List<Vanish> vanishes = doc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Descendants<Vanish>().ToList();

// Loop over the list of Vanish elements foreach (Vanish vanish in vanishes) { var parent = vanish?.Parent; var grandparent = parent?.Parent;

// If the grandparent is a Run remove it if (grandparent is Run) { grandparent.Remove(); } // If it's not a run remove the Vanish else if (parent is not null) { parent.RemoveAllChildren<Vanish>(); } } } }

# Remove the headers and footers from a

# word processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically remove all headers and footers in a word processing document. It contains an example RemoveHeadersAndFooters method to illustrate this task.

## RemoveHeadersAndFooters Method

You can use the RemoveHeadersAndFooters method to remove all header and footer information from a word processing document. Be aware that you must not only delete the header and footer parts from the document storage, you must also delete the references to those parts from the document too. The sample code demonstrates both steps in the operation. The RemoveHeadersAndFooters method accepts a single parameter, a string that indicates the path of the file that you want to modify.

C#

C#

static void RemoveHeadersAndFooters(string filename)

The complete code listing for the method can be found in the Sample Code section.

## Calling the Sample Method

To call the sample method, pass a string for the first parameter that contains the file name of the document that you want to modify as shown in the following code example.

C#

C#

string filename = args[0];

RemoveHeadersAndFooters(filename);

## How the Code Works

The RemoveHeadersAndFooters method works with the document you specify, deleting all of the header and footer parts and references to those parts. The code starts by opening the document, using the Open method and indicating that the document should be opened for read/write access (the final true parameter). Given the open document, the code uses the MainDocumentPart property to navigate to the main document, storing the reference in a variable named docPart .

C#

C#

// Given a document name, remove all of the headers and footers // from the document. using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filename, true)) { if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

// Get a reference to the main document part. var docPart = doc.MainDocumentPart;

## Confirm Header/Footer Existence

Given a reference to the document part, the code next determines if it has any work to do, i.e. if the document contains any headers or footers. To decide, the code calls the Count method of both the HeaderParts and FooterParts properties of the document part, and if either returns a value greater than 0, the code continues. Be aware that the HeaderParts and FooterParts properties each return an IEnumerable<T> of HeaderPart or FooterPart objects, respectively.

C#

C#

// Count the header and footer parts and continue if there // are any. if (docPart.HeaderParts.Count() > 0 || docPart.FooterParts.Count() > 0) {

## Remove the Header and Footer Parts

Given a collection of references to header and footer parts, you could write code to delete each one individually, but that is not necessary because of the Open XML SDK. Instead, you can call the DeleteParts method, passing in the collection of parts to be deleted─this simple method provides a shortcut for deleting a collection of parts. Therefore, the following few lines of code take the place of the loop that you would otherwise have to write yourself.

C#

C#

// Remove the header and footer parts. docPart.DeleteParts(docPart.HeaderParts); docPart.DeleteParts(docPart.FooterParts);

## Delete the Header and Footer References

At this point, the code has deleted the header and footer parts, but the document still contains orphaned references to those parts. Before the orphaned references can be removed, the code must retrieve a reference to the content of the document (that is, to the XML content contained within the main document part).

To remove the stranded references, the code first retrieves a collection of HeaderReference elements, converts the collection to a List , and then loops through the collection, calling the Remove() method for each element found. Note that the code converts the IEnumerable returned by the Descendants() method into a List so that it can delete items from the list, and that the HeaderReference type that is provided by the Open XML SDK makes it easy to refer to elements of type HeaderReference in the XML content. (Without that additional help, you would have to work with the details of the

XML content directly.) Once it has removed all the headers, the code repeats the operation with the footer elements.

C#

C#

// Get a reference to the root element of the main // document part. Document document = docPart.Document;

// Remove all references to the headers and footers.

// First, create a list of all descendants of type // HeaderReference. Then, navigate the list and call // Remove on each item to delete the reference. var headers = document.Descendants<HeaderReference>().ToList();

foreach (var header in headers) { header.Remove(); }

// First, create a list of all descendants of type // FooterReference. Then, navigate the list and call // Remove on each item to delete the reference. var footers = document.Descendants<FooterReference>().ToList();

foreach (var footer in footers) { footer.Remove(); }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete RemoveHeadersAndFooters code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

// Remove all of the headers and footers from a document. static void RemoveHeadersAndFooters(string filename) { // Given a document name, remove all of the headers and footers // from the document.

using (WordprocessingDocument doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filename, true)) { if (doc.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

// Get a reference to the main document part. var docPart = doc.MainDocumentPart;

// Count the header and footer parts and continue if there // are any. if (docPart.HeaderParts.Count() > 0 || docPart.FooterParts.Count() > 0) {

// Remove the header and footer parts. docPart.DeleteParts(docPart.HeaderParts); docPart.DeleteParts(docPart.FooterParts);

// Get a reference to the root element of the main // document part. Document document = docPart.Document;

// Remove all references to the headers and footers.

// First, create a list of all descendants of type // HeaderReference. Then, navigate the list and call // Remove on each item to delete the reference. var headers = document.Descendants<HeaderReference> ().ToList();

foreach (var header in headers) { header.Remove(); }

// First, create a list of all descendants of type // FooterReference. Then, navigate the list and call // Remove on each item to delete the reference. var footers = document.Descendants<FooterReference> ().ToList();

foreach (var footer in footers) { footer.Remove(); } } } }

# Replace Text in a Word Document Using

# SAX (Simple API for XML)

Article • 04/30/2025

This topic shows how to use the Open XML SDK to search and replace text in a Word document with the Open XML SDK using the Simple API for XML (SAX) approach. For more information about the basic structure of a WordprocessingML document, see Structure of a WordprocessingML document.

## Why Use the SAX Approach?

The Open XML SDK provides two ways to parse Office Open XML files: the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Simple API for XML (SAX). The DOM approach is designed to make it easy to query and parse Open XML files by using strongly-typed classes. However, the DOM approach requires loading entire Open XML parts into memory, which can lead to slower processing and Out of Memory exceptions when working with very large parts. The SAX approach reads in the XML in an Open XML part one element at a time without reading in the entire part into memory giving noncached, forward-only access to the XML data, which makes it a better choice when reading very large parts.

## Accessing the MainDocumentPart

The text of a Word document is stored in the MainDocumentPart, so the first step to finding and replacing text is to access the Word document's MainDocumentPart . To do that we first use the WordprocessingDocument.Open method passing in the path to the document as the first parameter and a second parameter true to indicate that we are opening the file for editing. Then make sure that the MainDocumentPart is not null.

C#

// Open the WordprocessingDocument for editing using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(path, true)) { // Access the MainDocumentPart and make sure it is not null MainDocumentPart? mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart;

if (mainDocumentPart is not null)

## Create Memory Stream, OpenXmlReader, and

## OpenXmlWriter

With the DOM approach to editing documents, the entire part is read into memory, so we can use the Open XML SDK's strongly typed classes to access the Text class to access the document's text and edit it. The SAX approach, however, uses the OpenXmlPartReader and OpenXmlPartWriter classes, which access a part's stream with forward-only access. The advantage of this is that the entire part does not need to be loaded into memory, which is faster and uses less memory, but since the same part cannot be opened in multiple streams at the same time, we cannot create a OpenXmlReader to read a part and a OpenXmlWriter to edit the same part at the same time. The solution to this is to create an additional memory stream and write the updated part to the new memory stream then use the stream to update the part when OpenXmlReader and OpenXmlWriter have been disposed. In the code below we create the MemoryStream to store the updated part and create an OpenXmlReader for the MainDocumentPart and a OpenXmlWriter to write to the MemoryStream

C#

// Create a MemoryStream to store the updated MainDocumentPart using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream()) { // Create an OpenXmlReader to read the main document part // and an OpenXmlWriter to write to the MemoryStream using (OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlPartReader.Create(mainDocumentPart)) using (OpenXmlWriter writer = OpenXmlPartWriter.Create(memoryStream))

## Reading the Part and Writing to the New Stream

Now that we have an OpenXmlReader to read the part and an OpenXmlWriter to write to the new MemoryStream we use the Read method to read each element in the part. As each element is read in we check if it is of type Text and if it is, we use the <xrefDocumentFormat.OpenXml.OpenXmlReader.GetText*> method to access the text and use Replace to update the text. If it is not a Text element, then we write it to the stream unchanged.

７ Note

In a Word document text can be separated into multiple Text elements, so if you are replacing a phrase and not a single word, it's best to replace one word at a time.

C#

// Write the XML declaration with the version "1.0". writer.WriteStartDocument();

// Read the elements from the MainDocumentPart while (reader.Read()) { // Check if the element is of type Text if (reader.ElementType == typeof(Text)) { // If it is the start of an element write the start element and the updated text if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader);

string text = reader.GetText().Replace(textToReplace, replacementText);

writer.WriteString(text);

} else { // Close the element writer.WriteEndElement(); } } else // Write the other XML elements without editing { if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader); } else if (reader.IsEndElement) { writer.WriteEndElement(); } } }

## Writing the New Stream to the MainDocumentPart

With the updated part written to the memory stream the last step is to set the MemoryStream 's position to 0 and use the FeedData method to replace the MainDocumentPart with the updated stream.

C#

// Set the MemoryStream's position to 0 and replace the MainDocumentPart memoryStream.Position = 0; mainDocumentPart.FeedData(memoryStream);

## Sample Code

Below is the complete sample code to replace text in a Word document using the SAX (Simple API for XML) approach.

C#

void ReplaceTextWithSAX(string path, string textToReplace, string replacementText) { // Open the WordprocessingDocument for editing using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(path, true)) { // Access the MainDocumentPart and make sure it is not null MainDocumentPart? mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart;

if (mainDocumentPart is not null) { // Create a MemoryStream to store the updated MainDocumentPart using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream()) { // Create an OpenXmlReader to read the main document part // and an OpenXmlWriter to write to the MemoryStream using (OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlPartReader.Create(mainDocumentPart)) using (OpenXmlWriter writer = OpenXmlPartWriter.Create(memoryStream)) { // Write the XML declaration with the version "1.0". writer.WriteStartDocument();

// Read the elements from the MainDocumentPart while (reader.Read()) {

// Check if the element is of type Text if (reader.ElementType == typeof(Text)) { // If it is the start of an element write the start element and the updated text if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader);

string text = reader.GetText().Replace(textToReplace, replacementText);

writer.WriteString(text);

} else { // Close the element writer.WriteEndElement(); } } else // Write the other XML elements without editing { if (reader.IsStartElement) { writer.WriteStartElement(reader); } else if (reader.IsEndElement) { writer.WriteEndElement(); } } } } // Set the MemoryStream's position to 0 and replace the MainDocumentPart memoryStream.Position = 0; mainDocumentPart.FeedData(memoryStream); } } } }

# Replace the header in a word processing

# document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to replace the header in word processing document programmatically.

## Structure of the Header Reference Element

In this example you are going to delete the header part from the target file and create another header part. You are also going to delete the reference to the existing header and create a reference to the new header. Therefore it is useful to familiarize yourself with headers and the header reference element. The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the header reference element.

## headerReference (Header Reference)

This element specifies a single header which shall be associated with the current section in the document. This header shall be referenced via the id attribute, which specifies an explicit relationship to the appropriate Header part in the WordprocessingML package.

If the relationship type of the relationship specified by this element is not https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/header , is not present, or does not have a TargetMode attribute value of Internal, then the document shall be considered non-conformant.

Within each section of a document there may be up to three different types of headers:

First page header

Odd page header

Even page header

The header type specified by the current headerReference is specified via the type attribute.

If any type of header is omitted for a given section, then the following rules shall apply.

If no headerReference for the first page header is specified and the titlePg element is specified, then the first page header shall be inherited from the previous

section or, if this is the first section in the document, a new blank header shall be created. If the titlePg element is not specified, then no first page header shall be shown, and the odd page header shall be used in its place.

If no headerReference for the even page header is specified and the evenAndOddHeaders element is specified, then the even page header shall be inherited from the previous section or, if this is the first section in the document, a new blank header shall be created. If the evenAndOddHeaders element is not specified, then no even page header shall be shown, and the odd page header shall be used in its place.

If no headerReference for the odd page header is specified then the even page header shall be inherited from the previous section or, if this is the first section in the document, a new blank header shall be created.

Example: Consider a three page document with different first, odd, and even page header defined as follows:

This document defines three headers, each of which has a relationship from the document part with a unique relationship ID, as shown in the following packaging markup:

XML

<Relationships xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships"> … <Relationship Id="rId2" Type="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/h eader" Target="header1.xml" /> <Relationship Id="rId3" Type="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/h eader" Target="header2.xml" /> <Relationship Id="rId5" Type="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/h eader" Target="header3.xml" />

… </Relationships>

These relationships are then referenced in the section's properties using the following WordprocessingML:

XML

<w:sectPr> … <w:headerReference r:id="rId3" w:type="first" /> <w:headerReference r:id="rId5" w:type="default" /> <w:headerReference r:id="rId2" w:type="even" /> … </w:sectPr>

The resulting section shall use the header part with relationship id rId3 for the first page, the header part with relationship id rId2 for all subsequent even pages, and the header part with relationship id rId5 for all subsequent odd pages. end example

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## Sample Code

The following code example shows how to replace the header in a word processing document with the header from another word processing document. To call the method, AddHeaderFromTo , you can use the following code segment as an example.

C#

C#

string fromFile = args[0]; string toFile = args[1];

AddHeaderFromTo(fromFile, toFile);

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq;

static void AddHeaderFromTo(string fromFile, string toFile) { // Replace header in target document with header of source document. using (WordprocessingDocument wdDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(toFile, true)) using (WordprocessingDocument wdDocSource = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fromFile, true)) { if (wdDocSource.MainDocumentPart is null || wdDocSource.MainDocumentPart.HeaderParts is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or HeaderParts is null."); }

if (wdDoc.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

MainDocumentPart mainPart = wdDoc.MainDocumentPart;

// Delete the existing header part. mainPart.DeleteParts(mainPart.HeaderParts);

// Create a new header part. DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.HeaderPart headerPart = mainPart.AddNewPart<HeaderPart>();

// Get Id of the headerPart. string rId = mainPart.GetIdOfPart(headerPart);

// Feed target headerPart with source headerPart.

DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.HeaderPart? firstHeader = wdDocSource.MainDocumentPart.HeaderParts.FirstOrDefault();

wdDocSource.MainDocumentPart.HeaderParts.FirstOrDefault();

if (firstHeader is not null) { headerPart.FeedData(firstHeader.GetStream()); }

if (mainPart.Document.Body is null) {

throw new ArgumentNullException("Body is null."); }

// Get SectionProperties and Replace HeaderReference with new Id.

IEnumerable<DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing.SectionProperties> sectPrs = mainPart.Document.Body.Elements<SectionProperties>(); foreach (var sectPr in sectPrs) { // Delete existing references to headers. sectPr.RemoveAllChildren<HeaderReference>();

// Create the new header reference node. sectPr.PrependChild<HeaderReference>(new HeaderReference() { Id = rId }); } } }

# Replace the styles parts in a word

# processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically replace the styles in a word processing document with the styles from another word processing document. It contains an example ReplaceStyles method to illustrate this task, as well as the ReplaceStylesPart and ExtractStylesPart supporting methods.

## About Styles Storage

A word processing document package, such as a file that has a .docx extension, is in fact a .zip file that consists of several parts. You can think of each part as being similar to an external file. A part has a particular content type, and can contain content equal to the content of an external XML file, binary file, image file, and so on, depending on the type. The standard that defines how Open XML documents are stored in .zip files is called the Open Packaging Conventions. For more information about the Open Packaging Conventions, see ISO/IEC 29500-2 .

Styles are stored in dedicated parts within a word processing document package. A Microsoft Word 2010 document contains a single styles part. later versions of Microsoft Word add a second stylesWithEffects part. The following image from the Document Explorer in the Open XML SDK Productivity Tool for Microsoft Office shows the document parts in a sample Word 2013+ document that contains styles.

Figure 1. Styles parts in a word processing document

In order to provide for "round-tripping" a document from Word 2013+ to Word 2010 and back, Word 2013+ maintains both the original styles part and the new styles part. (The Office Open XML File Formats specification requires that Microsoft Word ignore any parts that it does not recognize; Word 2010 does not notice the stylesWithEffects part that Word 2013+ adds to the document.)

The code example provided in this topic can be used to replace these styles parts.

## ReplaceStyles Method

You can use the ReplaceStyles sample method to replace the styles in a word processing document with the styles in another word processing document. The ReplaceStyles method accepts two parameters: the first parameter contains a string that indicates the path of the file that contains the styles to extract. The second parameter contains a string that indicates the path of the file to which to copy the styles, effectively completely replacing the styles.

C#

static void ReplaceStyles(string fromDoc, string toDoc)

The complete code listing for the ReplaceStyles method and its supporting methods can be found in the Sample Code section.

## Calling the Sample Method

To call the sample method, you pass a string for the first parameter that indicates the path of the file with the styles to extract, and a string for the second parameter that represents the path to the file in which to replace the styles. The following sample code shows an example. When the code finishes executing, the styles in the target document will have been replaced, and consequently the appearance of the text in the document will reflect the new styles.

C#

string fromDoc = args[0]; string toDoc = args[1];

ReplaceStyles(fromDoc, toDoc);

## How the Code Works

The code extracts and replaces the styles part first, and then the stylesWithEffects part second, and relies on two supporting methods to do most of the work. The ExtractStylesPart method has the job of extracting the content of the styles or stylesWithEffects part, and placing it in an XDocument object. The ReplaceStylesPart method takes the object created by ExtractStylesPart and uses its content to replace the styles or stylesWithEffects part in the target document.

C#

// Extract and replace the styles part. XDocument? node = ExtractStylesPart(fromDoc, false);

if (node is not null) { ReplaceStylesPart(toDoc, node, false); }

The final parameter in the signature for either the ExtractStylesPart or the ReplaceStylesPart method determines whether the styles part or the stylesWithEffects part is employed. A value of false indicates that you want to extract and replace the styles part. The absence of a value (the parameter is optional), or a value of true (the default), means that you want to extract and replace the stylesWithEffects part.

C#

// Extract and replace the stylesWithEffects part. To fully support // round-tripping from Word 2010 to Word 2007, you should // replace this part, as well. node = ExtractStylesPart(fromDoc);

if (node is not null) { ReplaceStylesPart(toDoc, node); }

return;

For more information about the ExtractStylesPart method, see the associated sample. The following section explains the ReplaceStylesPart method.

## ReplaceStylesPart Method

The ReplaceStylesPart method can be used to replace the styles or styleWithEffects part in a document, given an XDocument instance that contains the same part for a Word 2010 or Word 2013+ document (as shown in the sample code earlier in this topic, the ExtractStylesPart method can be used to obtain that instance). The ReplaceStylesPart method accepts three parameters: the first parameter contains a string that indicates the path to the file that you want to modify. The second parameter contains an XDocument object that contains the styles or stylesWithEffect part from another word processing document, and the third indicates whether you want to replace the styles part, or the stylesWithEffects part (as shown in the sample code earlier in this topic, you will need to call this procedure twice for Word 2013+ documents, replacing each part with the corresponding part from a source document).

C#

static void ReplaceStylesPart(string fileName, XDocument newStyles, bool setStylesWithEffectsPart = true)

## How the ReplaceStylesPart Code Works

The ReplaceStylesPart method examines the document you specify, looking for the styles or stylesWithEffects part. If the requested part exists, the method saves the supplied XDocument into the selected part.

The code starts by opening the document by using the Open method and indicating that the document should be open for read/write access (the final true parameter). Given the open document, the code uses the MainDocumentPart property to navigate to the main document part, and then prepares a variable named stylesPart to hold a reference to the styles part.

C#

// Open the document for write access and get a reference. using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (document.MainDocumentPart is null || (document.MainDocumentPart.StyleDefinitionsPart is null && document.MainDocumentPart.StylesWithEffectsPart is null)) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or one or both of the Styles parts is null."); }

// Get a reference to the main document part. var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart;

// Assign a reference to the appropriate part to the // stylesPart variable.

StylesPart? stylesPart = null;

## Find the Correct Styles Part

The code next retrieves a reference to the requested styles part, using the setStylesWithEffectsPart Boolean parameter. Based on this value, the code retrieves a reference to the requested styles part, and stores it in the stylesPart variable.

C#

if (setStylesWithEffectsPart) { stylesPart = docPart.StylesWithEffectsPart; } else { stylesPart = docPart.StyleDefinitionsPart; }

## Save the Part Contents

Assuming that the requested part exists, the code must save the entire contents of the XDocument passed to the method to the part. Each part provides a GetStream() method, which returns a Stream. The code passes the Stream instance to the constructor of the StreamWriter(Stream) class, creating a stream writer around the stream of the part. Finally, the code calls the Save(Stream) method of the XDocument, saving its contents into the styles part.

C#

// If the part exists, populate it with the new styles. if (stylesPart is not null) { newStyles.Save(new StreamWriter(stylesPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))); }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete ReplaceStyles , ReplaceStylesPart , and ExtractStylesPart methods in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

// Replace the styles in the "to" document with the styles in // the "from" document. static void ReplaceStyles(string fromDoc, string toDoc) {

// Extract and replace the styles part. XDocument? node = ExtractStylesPart(fromDoc, false);

if (node is not null) { ReplaceStylesPart(toDoc, node, false); }

// Extract and replace the stylesWithEffects part. To fully support // round-tripping from Word 2010 to Word 2007, you should // replace this part, as well. node = ExtractStylesPart(fromDoc);

if (node is not null) {

ReplaceStylesPart(toDoc, node); }

return; }

// Given a file and an XDocument instance that contains the content of // a styles or stylesWithEffects part, replace the styles in the file // with the styles in the XDocument.

static void ReplaceStylesPart(string fileName, XDocument newStyles, bool setStylesWithEffectsPart = true) {

// Open the document for write access and get a reference. using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { if (document.MainDocumentPart is null || (document.MainDocumentPart.StyleDefinitionsPart is null && document.MainDocumentPart.StylesWithEffectsPart is null)) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or one or both of the Styles parts is null."); }

// Get a reference to the main document part. var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart;

// Assign a reference to the appropriate part to the // stylesPart variable.

StylesPart? stylesPart = null;

if (setStylesWithEffectsPart) { stylesPart = docPart.StylesWithEffectsPart; } else { stylesPart = docPart.StyleDefinitionsPart; }

// If the part exists, populate it with the new styles. if (stylesPart is not null) { newStyles.Save(new StreamWriter(stylesPart.GetStream(FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))); } } }

// Extract the styles or stylesWithEffects part from a // word processing document as an XDocument instance. static XDocument ExtractStylesPart(string fileName, bool getStylesWithEffectsPart = true)

{ // Declare a variable to hold the XDocument. XDocument? styles = null;

// Open the document for read access and get a reference. using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { // Get a reference to the main document part. var docPart = document.MainDocumentPart;

if (docPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

// Assign a reference to the appropriate part to the // stylesPart variable. StylesPart stylesPart;

if (getStylesWithEffectsPart && docPart.StylesWithEffectsPart is not null) { stylesPart = docPart.StylesWithEffectsPart; } else if (docPart.StyleDefinitionsPart is not null) { stylesPart = docPart.StyleDefinitionsPart; } else { throw new ArgumentNullException("StyleWithEffectsPart and StyleDefinitionsPart are undefined"); }

using (var reader = XmlNodeReader.Create(stylesPart.GetStream(FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))) { // Create the XDocument. styles = XDocument.Load(reader); } } // Return the XDocument instance. return styles; }

# Retrieve application property values

# from a word processing document

Article • 01/31/2024

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve an application property from a Microsoft Word document, without loading the document into Word. It contains example code to illustrate this task.

## Retrieving Application Properties

To retrieve application document properties, you can retrieve the ExtendedFilePropertiesPart property of a WordprocessingDocument object, and then retrieve the specific application property you need. To do this, you must first get a reference to the document, as shown in the following code.

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) {

Given the reference to the WordprocessingDocument object, you can retrieve a reference to the ExtendedFilePropertiesPart property of the document. This object provides its own properties, each of which exposes one of the application document properties.

C#

if (document.ExtendedFilePropertiesPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("ExtendedFilePropertiesPart is null."); }

var props = document.ExtendedFilePropertiesPart.Properties;

Once you have the reference to the properties of ExtendedFilePropertiesPart, you can then retrieve any of the application properties, using simple code such as that shown in

the next example. Note that the code must confirm that the reference to each property isn't null of Nothing before retrieving its Text property. Unlike core properties, document properties aren't available if you (or the application) haven't specifically given them a value.

C#

if (props.Company is not null) Console.WriteLine("Company = " + props.Company.Text);

if (props.Lines is not null) Console.WriteLine("Lines = " + props.Lines.Text);

if (props.Manager is not null) Console.WriteLine("Manager = " + props.Manager.Text);

## Sample Code

The following is the complete code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using System; static void GetApplicationProperty(string fileName) { using (WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) {

if (document.ExtendedFilePropertiesPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("ExtendedFilePropertiesPart is null."); }

var props = document.ExtendedFilePropertiesPart.Properties;

if (props.Company is not null) Console.WriteLine("Company = " + props.Company.Text);

if (props.Lines is not null) Console.WriteLine("Lines = " + props.Lines.Text);

if (props.Manager is not null) Console.WriteLine("Manager = " + props.Manager.Text);

} }

# Retrieve comments from a word

# processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic describes how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically retrieve the comments from the main document part in a word processing document.

## Open the Existing Document for Read-only

## Access

To open an existing document, instantiate the WordprocessingDocument class as shown in the following using statement. In the same statement, open the word processing file at the specified fileName by using the Open(String, Boolean, OpenSettings) method. To open the file for editing the Boolean parameter is set to true . In this example you just need to read the file; therefore, you can open the file for read-only access by setting the Boolean parameter to false .

C#

C#

using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if (wordDoc.MainDocumentPart is null || wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart is null) { throw new System.ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or WordprocessingCommentsPart is null."); }

With v3.0.0+ the Close() method has been removed in favor of relying on the using statement. It ensures that the Dispose() method is automatically called when the closing brace is reached. The block that follows the using statement establishes a scope for the object that is created or named in the using statement. Because the WordprocessingDocument class in the Open XML SDK automatically saves and closes the object as part of its IDisposable implementation, and because Dispose() is

automatically called when you exit the block, you do not have to explicitly call Save() or Dispose() as long as you use a using statement.

## Comments Element

The comments and comment elements are crucial to working with comments in a word processing file. It is important in this code example to familiarize yourself with those elements.

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the comments element.

comments (Comments Collection)

This element specifies all of the comments defined in the current document. It is the root element of the comments part of a WordprocessingML document.

Consider the following WordprocessingML fragment for the content of a comments part in a WordprocessingML document:

XML

<w:comments> <w:comment … > … </w:comment> </w:comments>

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML schema segment defines the contents of the comments element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_Comments"> <sequence> <element name="comment" type="CT_Comment" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> </sequence> </complexType>

## Comment Element

The following information from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the comment element.

comment (Comment Content)

This element specifies the content of a single comment stored in the comments part of a WordprocessingML document.

If a comment is not referenced by document content via a matching id attribute on a valid use of the commentReference element, then it may be ignored when loading the document. If more than one comment shares the same value for the id attribute, then only one comment shall be loaded and the others may be ignored.

Consider a document with text with an annotated comment as follows:

This comment is represented by the following WordprocessingML fragment.

XML

<w:comment w:id="1" w:initials="User"> … </w:comment>

The comment element specifies the presence of a single comment within the comments part.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following XML schema segment defines the contents of the comment element.

XML

<complexType name="CT_Comment"> <complexContent> <extension base="CT_TrackChange"> <sequence> <group ref="EG_BlockLevelElts" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> </sequence>

<attribute name="initials" type="ST_String" use="optional"/> </extension> </complexContent> </complexType>

## How the Sample Code Works

After you have opened the file for read-only access, you instantiate the WordprocessingCommentsPart class. You can then display the inner text of the Comment element.

C#

C#

WordprocessingCommentsPart commentsPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart;

if (commentsPart is not null && commentsPart.Comments is not null) { foreach (Comment comment in commentsPart.Comments.Elements<Comment> ()) { Console.WriteLine(comment.InnerText); } }

## Sample Code

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System;

static void GetCommentsFromDocument(string fileName) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc =

WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, false)) { if (wordDoc.MainDocumentPart is null || wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart is null) { throw new System.ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or WordprocessingCommentsPart is null."); }

WordprocessingCommentsPart commentsPart = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.WordprocessingCommentsPart;

if (commentsPart is not null && commentsPart.Comments is not null) { foreach (Comment comment in commentsPart.Comments.Elements<Comment>()) { Console.WriteLine(comment.InnerText); } } } }

# Set a custom property in a word

# processing document

Article • 01/17/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically set a custom property in a word processing document. It contains an example SetCustomProperty method to illustrate this task.

The sample code also includes an enumeration that defines the possible types of custom properties. The SetCustomProperty method requires that you supply one of these values when you call the method.

C#

C#

enum PropertyTypes : int { YesNo, Text, DateTime, NumberInteger, NumberDouble }

## How Custom Properties Are Stored

It is important to understand how custom properties are stored in a word processing document. You can use the Productivity Tool for Microsoft Office, shown in Figure 1, to discover how they are stored. This tool enables you to open a document and view its parts and the hierarchy of parts. Figure 1 shows a test document after you run the code in the Calling the SetCustomProperty Method section of this article. The tool displays in the right-hand panes both the XML for the part and the reflected C# code that you can use to generate the contents of the part.

Figure 1. Open XML SDK Productivity Tool for Microsoft Office

The relevant XML is also extracted and shown here for ease of reading.

XML

<op:Properties xmlns:vt="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/docPropsVTy pes" xmlns:op="https://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/custom- properties"> <op:property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="2" name="Manager"> <vt:lpwstr>Mary</vt:lpwstr> </op:property> <op:property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="3" name="ReviewDate"> <vt:filetime>2010-12-21T00:00:00Z</vt:filetime> </op:property> </op:Properties>

If you examine the XML content, you will find the following:

Each property in the XML content consists of an XML element that includes the name and the value of the property. For each property, the XML content includes an fmtid attribute, which is always set to the same string value: {D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE} . Each property in the XML content includes a pid attribute, which must include an integer starting at 2 for the first property and incrementing for each successive property. Each property tracks its type (in the figure, the vt:lpwstr and vt:filetime element names define the types for each property).

The sample method that is provided here includes the code that is required to create or modify a custom document property in a Microsoft Word document. You can find the complete code listing for the method in the Sample Code section.

## SetCustomProperty Method

Use the SetCustomProperty method to set a custom property in a word processing document. The SetCustomProperty method accepts four parameters:

The name of the document to modify (string).

The name of the property to add or modify (string).

The value of the property (object).

The kind of property (one of the values in the PropertyTypes enumeration).

C#

C#

static string SetCustomProperty( string fileName, string propertyName, object propertyValue, PropertyTypes propertyType)

## Calling the SetCustomProperty Method

The SetCustomProperty method enables you to set a custom property, and returns the current value of the property, if it exists. To call the sample method, pass the file name, property name, property value, and property type parameters. The following sample code shows an example.

C#

C#

string fileName = args[0];

Console.WriteLine(string.Join("Manager = ", SetCustomProperty(fileName, "Manager", "Pedro", PropertyTypes.Text)));

Console.WriteLine(string.Join("Manager = ", SetCustomProperty(fileName, "Manager", "Bonnie", PropertyTypes.Text)));

Console.WriteLine(string.Join("ReviewDate = ", SetCustomProperty(fileName, "ReviewDate", DateTime.Parse("01/26/2024"), PropertyTypes.DateTime)));

After running this code, use the following procedure to view the custom properties from Word.

1. Open the .docx file in Word.
2. On the File tab, click Info.
3. Click Properties.
4. Click Advanced Properties.

The custom properties will display in the dialog box that appears, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Custom Properties in the Advanced Properties dialog box

## How the Code Works

The SetCustomProperty method starts by setting up some internal variables. Next, it examines the information about the property, and creates a new

CustomDocumentProperty based on the parameters that you have specified. The code also maintains a variable named propSet to indicate whether it successfully created the new property object. This code verifies the type of the property value, and then converts the input to the correct type, setting the appropriate property of the CustomDocumentProperty object.

７ Note

The CustomDocumentProperty type works much like a VBA Variant type. It maintains separate placeholders as properties for the various types of data it might contain.

C#

C#

string? returnValue = string.Empty;

var newProp = new CustomDocumentProperty(); bool propSet = false;

string? propertyValueString = propertyValue.ToString() ?? throw new System.ArgumentNullException("propertyValue can't be converted to a string.");

// Calculate the correct type. switch (propertyType) { case PropertyTypes.DateTime:

// Be sure you were passed a real date, // and if so, format in the correct way. // The date/time value passed in should // represent a UTC date/time. if ((propertyValue) is DateTime) { newProp.VTFileTime = new VTFileTime(string.Format("{0:s}Z", Convert.ToDateTime(propertyValue))); propSet = true; }

break;

case PropertyTypes.NumberInteger: if ((propertyValue) is int) { newProp.VTInt32 = new VTInt32(propertyValueString);

propSet = true; }

break;

case PropertyTypes.NumberDouble: if (propertyValue is double) { newProp.VTFloat = new VTFloat(propertyValueString); propSet = true; }

break;

case PropertyTypes.Text: newProp.VTLPWSTR = new VTLPWSTR(propertyValueString); propSet = true;

break;

case PropertyTypes.YesNo: if (propertyValue is bool) { // Must be lowercase. newProp.VTBool = new VTBool( Convert.ToBoolean(propertyValue).ToString().ToLower()); propSet = true; } break; }

if (!propSet) { // If the code was not able to convert the // property to a valid value, throw an exception. throw new InvalidDataException("propertyValue"); }

At this point, if the code has not thrown an exception, you can assume that the property is valid, and the code sets the FormatId and Name properties of the new custom property.

C#

C#

// Now that you have handled the parameters, start // working on the document.

newProp.FormatId = "{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}"; newProp.Name = propertyName;

## Working with the Document

Given the CustomDocumentProperty object, the code next interacts with the document that you supplied in the parameters to the SetCustomProperty procedure. The code starts by opening the document in read/write mode by using the Open method of the WordprocessingDocument class. The code attempts to retrieve a reference to the custom file properties part by using the CustomFilePropertiesPart property of the document.

C#

C#

using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { var customProps = document.CustomFilePropertiesPart;

If the code cannot find a custom properties part, it creates a new part, and adds a new set of properties to the part.

C#

C#

if (customProps is null) { // No custom properties? Add the part, and the // collection of properties now. customProps = document.AddCustomFilePropertiesPart(); customProps.Properties = new Properties(); }

Next, the code retrieves a reference to the Properties property of the custom properties part (that is, a reference to the properties themselves). If the code had to create a new custom properties part, you know that this reference is not null. However, for existing custom properties parts, it is possible, although highly unlikely, that the Properties property will be null. If so, the code cannot continue.

C#

C#

var props = customProps.Properties;

if (props is not null) {

If the property already exists, the code retrieves its current value, and then deletes the property. Why delete the property? If the new type for the property matches the existing type for the property, the code could set the value of the property to the new value. On the other hand, if the new type does not match, the code must create a new element, deleting the old one (it is the name of the element that defines its type—for more information, see Figure 1). It is simpler to always delete and then re-create the element. The code uses a simple LINQ query to find the first match for the property name.

C#

C#

var prop = props.FirstOrDefault(p => ((CustomDocumentProperty)p).Name!.Value == propertyName);

// Does the property exist? If so, get the return value, // and then delete the property. if (prop is not null) { returnValue = prop.InnerText; prop.Remove(); }

Now, you will know for sure that the custom property part exists, a property that has the same name as the new property does not exist, and that there may be other existing custom properties. The code performs the following steps:

1. Appends the new property as a child of the properties collection.

2. Loops through all the existing properties, and sets the pid attribute to increasing values, starting at 2.

3. Saves the part.

C#

C#

// Append the new property, and // fix up all the property ID values. // The PropertyId value must start at 2. props.AppendChild(newProp); int pid = 2; foreach (CustomDocumentProperty item in props) { item.PropertyId = pid++; }

Finally, the code returns the stored original property value.

C#

C#

return returnValue;

## Sample Code

The following is the complete SetCustomProperty code sample in C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static string SetCustomProperty( string fileName, string propertyName, object propertyValue, PropertyTypes propertyType) { // Given a document name, a property name/value, and the property type, // add a custom property to a document. The method returns the original // value, if it existed.

string? returnValue = string.Empty;

var newProp = new CustomDocumentProperty(); bool propSet = false;

string? propertyValueString = propertyValue.ToString() ?? throw new System.ArgumentNullException("propertyValue can't be converted to a string.");

// Calculate the correct type. switch (propertyType) { case PropertyTypes.DateTime:

// Be sure you were passed a real date, // and if so, format in the correct way. // The date/time value passed in should // represent a UTC date/time. if ((propertyValue) is DateTime) { newProp.VTFileTime = new VTFileTime(string.Format("{0:s}Z", Convert.ToDateTime(propertyValue))); propSet = true; }

break;

case PropertyTypes.NumberInteger: if ((propertyValue) is int) { newProp.VTInt32 = new VTInt32(propertyValueString); propSet = true; }

break;

case PropertyTypes.NumberDouble: if (propertyValue is double) { newProp.VTFloat = new VTFloat(propertyValueString); propSet = true; }

break;

case PropertyTypes.Text: newProp.VTLPWSTR = new VTLPWSTR(propertyValueString); propSet = true;

break;

case PropertyTypes.YesNo: if (propertyValue is bool) { // Must be lowercase.

newProp.VTBool = new VTBool(

Convert.ToBoolean(propertyValue).ToString().ToLower()); propSet = true; } break; }

if (!propSet) { // If the code was not able to convert the // property to a valid value, throw an exception. throw new InvalidDataException("propertyValue"); }

// Now that you have handled the parameters, start // working on the document. newProp.FormatId = "{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}"; newProp.Name = propertyName;

using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { var customProps = document.CustomFilePropertiesPart;

if (customProps is null) { // No custom properties? Add the part, and the // collection of properties now. customProps = document.AddCustomFilePropertiesPart(); customProps.Properties = new Properties(); }

var props = customProps.Properties;

if (props is not null) {

// This will trigger an exception if the property's Name // property is null, but if that happens, the property is damaged, // and probably should raise an exception.

var prop = props.FirstOrDefault(p => ((CustomDocumentProperty)p).Name!.Value == propertyName);

// Does the property exist? If so, get the return value, // and then delete the property. if (prop is not null) { returnValue = prop.InnerText; prop.Remove(); }

// Append the new property, and // fix up all the property ID values.

// The PropertyId value must start at 2. props.AppendChild(newProp); int pid = 2; foreach (CustomDocumentProperty item in props) { item.PropertyId = pid++; } } }

return returnValue; }

# Set the font for a text run

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to set the font for a portion of text within a word processing document programmatically.

## Packages and Document Parts

An Open XML document is stored as a package, whose format is defined by ISO/IEC 29500 . The package can have multiple parts with relationships between them. The relationship between parts controls the category of the document. A document can be defined as a word-processing document if its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a main document part. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a presentation part it can be defined as a presentation document. If its package-relationship item contains a relationship to a workbook part, it is defined as a spreadsheet document. In this how-to topic, you will use a word-processing document package.

## Structure of the Run Fonts Element

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification can be useful when working with rFonts element.

This element specifies the fonts which shall be used to display the text contents of this run. Within a single run, there may be up to four types of content present which shall each be allowed to use a unique font:

ASCII

High ANSI

Complex Script

East Asian

The use of each of these fonts shall be determined by the Unicode character values of the run content, unless manually overridden via use of the cs element.

If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the text shall be displayed in any default font which supports each type of content.

Consider a single text run with both Arabic and English text, as follows:

English ﺔﻴﺑﺮﻌﻟا

This content may be expressed in a single WordprocessingML run:

XML

<w:r> <w:t>English ﺔﯿﺑﺮﻌﻟا</w:t> </w:r>

Although it is in the same run, the contents are in different font faces by specifying a different font for ASCII and CS characters in the run:

XML

<w:r> <w:rPr> <w:rFonts w:ascii="Courier New" w:cs="Times New Roman" /> </w:rPr> <w:t>English ﺔﯿﺑﺮﻌﻟا</w:t> </w:r>

This text run shall therefore use the Courier New font for all characters in the ASCII range, and shall use the Times New Roman font for all characters in the Complex Script range.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

## How the Sample Code Works

After opening the package file for read/write, the code creates a RunProperties object that contains a RunFonts object that has its Ascii property set to "Arial". RunProperties and RunFonts objects represent run properties rPr elements and run fonts elements rFont , respectively, in the Open XML Wordprocessing schema. Use a RunProperties object to specify the properties of a given text run. In this case, to set the font of the run to Arial, the code creates a RunFonts object and then sets the Ascii value to "Arial".

C#

C#

// Set the font to Arial to the first Run. // Use an object initializer for RunProperties and rPr. RunProperties rPr = new RunProperties( new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Arial" });

The code then creates a Run object that represents the first text run of the document. The code instantiates a Run and sets it to the first text run of the document. The code then adds the RunProperties object to the Run object using the PrependChild method. The PrependChild method adds an element as the first child element to the specified element in the in-memory XML structure. In this case, running the code sample produces an in-memory XML structure where the RunProperties element is added as the first child element of the Run element. There is no need to call Save directly, because we are inside of a using statement.

C#

C#

if (package.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

Run r = package.MainDocumentPart.Document.Descendants<Run>().First(); r.PrependChild<RunProperties>(rPr);

７ Note

This code example assumes that the test word processing document at fileName path contains at least one text run.

The following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

C#

static void SetRunFont(string fileName) { // Open a Wordprocessing document for editing. using (WordprocessingDocument package = WordprocessingDocument.Open(fileName, true)) { // Set the font to Arial to the first Run. // Use an object initializer for RunProperties and rPr. RunProperties rPr = new RunProperties( new RunFonts() { Ascii = "Arial" });

if (package.MainDocumentPart is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart is null."); }

Run r = package.MainDocumentPart.Document.Descendants<Run> ().First(); r.PrependChild<RunProperties>(rPr); } }

# Validate a word processing document

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic shows how to use the classes in the Open XML SDK for Office to programmatically validate a word processing document.

## How the Sample Code Works

This code example consists of two methods. The first method, ValidateWordDocument, is used to validate a regular Word file. It doesn't throw any exceptions and closes the file after running the validation check. The second method, ValidateCorruptedWordDocument, starts by inserting some text into the body, which causes a schema error. It then validates the Word file, in which case the method throws an exception on trying to open the corrupted file. The validation is done by using the Validate method. The code displays information about any errors that are found, in addition to the count of errors.

） Important

Notice that you cannot run the code twice after corrupting the file in the first run. You have to start with a new Word file.

Following is the complete sample code in both C# and Visual Basic.

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Validation; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System;

static void ValidateWordDocument(string filepath) { using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) { try { OpenXmlValidator validator = new OpenXmlValidator();

int count = 0; foreach (ValidationErrorInfo error in validator.Validate(wordprocessingDocument)) { count++; Console.WriteLine("Error " + count); Console.WriteLine("Description: " + error.Description); Console.WriteLine("ErrorType: " + error.ErrorType); Console.WriteLine("Node: " + error.Node); if (error.Path is not null) { Console.WriteLine("Path: " + error.Path.XPath); } if (error.Part is not null) { Console.WriteLine("Part: " + error.Part.Uri); } Console.WriteLine("------------------------------------- ------"); }

Console.WriteLine("count={0}", count); }

catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); } } }

static void ValidateCorruptedWordDocument(string filepath) { // Insert some text into the body, this would cause Schema Error using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) {

if (wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart is null || wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException("MainDocumentPart and/or Body is null."); }

// Insert some text into the body, this would cause Schema Error Body body = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body; Run run = new Run(new Text("some text")); body.Append(run);

try { OpenXmlValidator validator = new OpenXmlValidator(); int count = 0;

foreach (ValidationErrorInfo error in validator.Validate(wordprocessingDocument)) { count++; Console.WriteLine("Error " + count); Console.WriteLine("Description: " + error.Description); Console.WriteLine("ErrorType: " + error.ErrorType); Console.WriteLine("Node: " + error.Node); if (error.Path is not null) { Console.WriteLine("Path: " + error.Path.XPath); } if (error.Part is not null) { Console.WriteLine("Part: " + error.Part.Uri); } Console.WriteLine("------------------------------------- ------"); }

Console.WriteLine("count={0}", count); }

catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); } } }

# Working with paragraphs

Article • 01/12/2024

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK Paragraph class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format WordprocessingML schema.

## Paragraphs in WordprocessingML

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Open XML WordprocessingML element used to represent a paragraph in a WordprocessingML document.

The most basic unit of block-level content within a WordprocessingML document, paragraphs are stored using the <p> element. A paragraph defines a distinct division of content that begins on a new line. A paragraph can contain three pieces of information: optional paragraph properties, inline content (typically runs), and a set of optional revision IDs used to compare the content of two documents.

A paragraph's properties are specified via the <pPr> element. Some examples of paragraph properties are alignment, border, hyphenation override, indentation, line spacing, shading, text direction, and widow/orphan control.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists the most common Open XML SDK classes used when working with paragraphs.

ﾉ Expand table

WordprocessingML element Open XML SDK Class

## Paragraph Class

The Open XML SDK Paragraph class represents the paragraph <p> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents as discussed above. Use the Paragraph object to manipulate individual <p> elements in a WordprocessingML document.

### ParagraphProperties Class

In WordprocessingML, a paragraph's properties are specified via the paragraph properties <pPr> element. Some examples of paragraph properties are alignment, border, hyphenation override, indentation, line spacing, shading, text direction, and widow/orphan control. The OXML SDK ParagraphProperties class represents the <pPr> element.

### Run Class

Paragraphs in a word-processing document most often contain text. In the OXML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents, the run <r> element is provided to demarcate a region of text. The OXML SDK Run class represents the <r> element.

### Text Object

With the <r> element, the text <t> element is the container for the text that makes up the document content. The OXML SDK Text class represents the <t> element.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code instantiates an Open XML SDKParagraph object and then uses it to add text to a WordprocessingML document.

C#

C#

// <Snippet0> using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing; using System;

static void WriteToWordDoc(string filepath, string txt) {

// Open a WordprocessingDocument for editing using the filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) { if (wordprocessingDocument is null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(wordprocessingDocument)); } // Assign a reference to the existing document body. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ?? wordprocessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

// Add a paragraph with some text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run()); run.AppendChild(new Text(txt)); } } // </Snippet0>

WriteToWordDoc(args[0], args[1]);

# Working with runs

Article • 01/12/2024

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK Run class and how it relates to the Open XML File Format WordprocessingML schema.

## Runs in WordprocessingML

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Open XML WordprocessingML run element.

The next level of the document hierarchy [after the paragraph] is the run, which defines a region of text with a common set of properties. A run is represented by an r element, which allows the producer to combine breaks, styles, or formatting properties, applying the same information to all the parts of the run.

Just as a paragraph can have properties, so too can a run. All of the elements inside an r element have their properties controlled by a corresponding optional rPr run properties element, which must be the first child of the r element. In turn, the rPr element is a container for a set of property elements that are applied to the rest of the children of the r element. The elements inside the rPr container element allow the consumer to control whether the text in the following t elements is bold, underlined, or visible, for example. Some examples of run properties are bold, border, character style, color, font, font size, italic, kerning, disable spelling/grammar check, shading, small caps, strikethrough, text direction, and underline.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists the most common Open XML SDK classes used when working with runs.

## Run Class

The Open XML SDK Run class represents the run <r> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents as discussed above. Use a Run object to manipulate an individual <r> element in a WordprocessingML document.

### RunProperties Class

In WordprocessingML, the properties for a run element are specified using the run properties <rPr> element. Some examples of run properties are bold, border, character style, color, font, font size, italic, kerning, disable spelling/grammar check, shading, small caps, strikethrough, text direction, and underline. Use a RunProperties object to set the properties for a run in a WordprocessingML document.

### Text Object

With the <r> element, the text ( <t> ) element is the container for the text that makes up the document content. The OXML SDK Text class represents the <t> element. Use a Text object to place text in a Wordprocessing document.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code adds text to the main document surface of the specified WordprocessingML document. A Run object demarcates a region of text within the paragraph and then a RunProperties object is used to apply bold formatting to the run.

C#

C#

using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging; using DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing;

static void WriteToWordDoc(string filepath, string txt) { // Open a WordprocessingDocument for editing using the filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) { // Assign a reference to the existing document body. MainDocumentPart mainDocumentPart = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart ??

wordprocessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); mainDocumentPart.Document ??= new Document(); Body body = mainDocumentPart.Document.Body ?? mainDocumentPart.Document.AppendChild(new Body());

// Add new text. Paragraph para = body.AppendChild(new Paragraph()); Run run = para.AppendChild(new Run());

// Apply bold formatting to the run. RunProperties runProperties = run.AppendChild(new RunProperties(new Bold())); run.AppendChild(new Text(txt)); } }

When this code is run, the following XML is written to the WordprocessingML document specified in the preceding code.

XML

<w:p> <w:r> <w:rPr> <w:b /> </w:rPr> <w:t>String from WriteToWordDoc method.</w:t> </w:r> </w:p>

# Working with WordprocessingML tables

Article • 01/21/2025

This topic discusses the Open XML SDK Table class and how it relates to the Office Open XML File Formats WordprocessingML schema.

## Tables in WordprocessingML

The following text from the ISO/IEC 29500 specification introduces the Open XML WordprocessingML table element.

Another type of block-level content in WordprocessingML, A table is a set of paragraphs (and other block-level content) arranged in rows and columns.

Tables in WordprocessingML are defined via the tbl element, which is analogous to the HTML <table> tag. The table element specifies the location of a table present in the document.

A tbl element has two elements that define its properties: tblPr , which defines the set of table-wide properties (such as style and width), and tblGrid , which defines the grid layout of the table. A tbl element can also contain an arbitrary non-zero number of rows, where each row is specified with a tr element. Each tr element can contain an arbitrary non-zero number of cells, where each cell is specified with a tc element.

© ISO/IEC 29500: 2016

The following table lists some of the most common Open XML SDK classes used when working with tables.

ﾉ Expand table

XML element Open XML SDK Class

Content Cell Content Cell

gridCol GridColumn

tblGrid TableGrid

tblPr TableProperties

tc TableCell

tr TableRow

## Open XML SDK Table Class

The Open XML SDK Table class represents the <tbl> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents as discussed above. Use a Table object to manipulate an individual table in a WordprocessingML document.

## TableProperties Class

The Open XML SDK TableProperties class represents the <tblPr> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents. The <tblPr> element defines table-wide properties for a table. Use a TableProperties object to set table-wide properties for a table in a WordprocessingML document.

## TableGrid Class

The Open XML SDK TableGrid class represents the <tblGrid> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents. In conjunction with grid column <gridCol> child elements, the <tblGrid> element defines the columns for a table and specifies the default width of table cells in the columns. Use a TableGrid object to define the columns in a table in a WordprocessingML document.

## GridColumn Class

The Open XML SDK GridColumn class represents the grid column <gridCol> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents. The <gridCol> element is a child element of the <tblGrid> element and defines a single column in a table in a WordprocessingML document. Use the GridColumn class to manipulate an individual column in a WordprocessingML document.

## TableRow Class

The Open XML SDK TableRow class represents the table row <tr> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents. The <tr> element defines a row in a table in a WordprocessingML document, analogous to the <tr> tag in HTML. A table row can also have formatting applied to it using a table row properties <trPr> element. The Open XML SDK TableRowProperties class represents the <trPr> element.

## TableCell Class

The Open XML SDK TableCell class represents the table cell <tc> element defined in the Open XML File Format schema for WordprocessingML documents. The <tc> element defines a cell in a table in a WordprocessingML document, analogous to the <td> tag in HTML. A table cell can also have formatting applied to it using a table cell properties <tcPr> element. The Open XML SDK TableCellProperties class represents the <tcPr> element.

## Open XML SDK Code Example

The following code inserts a table with 1 row and 3 columns into a document.

C#

C#

static string InsertTableInDoc(string filepath) { // Open a WordprocessingDocument for editing using the filepath. using (WordprocessingDocument wordprocessingDocument = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filepath, true)) { // Assign a reference to the existing document body or add one if necessary.

if (wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart is null) { wordprocessingDocument.AddMainDocumentPart(); }

if (wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart!.Document is null) { wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart.Document = new Document(); }

if (wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body is null) { wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body = new Body(); }

Body body = wordprocessingDocument.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body;

// Create a table.

Table tbl = new Table();

// Set the style and width for the table. TableProperties tableProp = new TableProperties(); TableStyle tableStyle = new TableStyle() { Val = "TableGrid" };

// Make the table width 100% of the page width. TableWidth tableWidth = new TableWidth() { Width = "5000", Type = TableWidthUnitValues.Pct };

// Apply tableProp.Append(tableStyle, tableWidth); tbl.AppendChild(tableProp);

// Add 3 columns to the table. TableGrid tg = new TableGrid(new GridColumn(), new GridColumn(), new GridColumn()); tbl.AppendChild(tg);

// Create 1 row to the table. TableRow tr1 = new TableRow();

// Add a cell to each column in the row. TableCell tc1 = new TableCell(new Paragraph(new Run(new Text("1")))); TableCell tc2 = new TableCell(new Paragraph(new Run(new Text("2")))); TableCell tc3 = new TableCell(new Paragraph(new Run(new Text("3")))); tr1.Append(tc1, tc2, tc3);

// Add row to the table. tbl.AppendChild(tr1);

// Add the table to the document body.AppendChild(tbl);

return tbl.LocalName; } }

When this code is run, the following XML is written to the WordprocessingML document specified in the preceding code.
